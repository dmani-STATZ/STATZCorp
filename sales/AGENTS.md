# AGENTS.md — `sales` App

## 1. Purpose of This File

This file defines safe-edit guidance for the `sales` Django app for AI coding agents and future developers. It is not a repeat of `CONTEXT.md` — read `sales/CONTEXT.md` first for domain context and the `DIBBS_System_Spec` for intent and vision, then use this file when making code changes.

---

## 2. App Scope

**Owns:** The entire DIBBS bidding lifecycle — file import, solicitation triage, supplier matching, RFQ dispatch, quote entry, government bid assembly, BQ file export, and SAM.gov award tracking.

**Owns operationally:** `ImportBatch`, `ImportJob`, `Solicitation`, `SolicitationLine`, `ApprovedSource`, `SupplierNSN`, `SupplierFSC`, `SupplierMatch`, `SupplierRFQ`, `SupplierContactLog`, `SupplierQuote`, `GovernmentBid`, `CompanyCAGE`, `EmailTemplate`, `DibbsAward`, `AwardImportBatch`, `NoQuoteCAGE`.

**Does not own:** `suppliers.Supplier` — this is the central supplier record from the `suppliers` app. Every FK to a supplier crosses app boundaries.

**Does not own:** Authentication (`auth.User`), contracts data (`contracts.models.Clin` is read for NSN backfill only).

**App type:** Core domain app. This is the operational heart of the product. It is tightly coupled internally and fragile in the import → match → RFQ → bid status pipeline.

## 3. Read This Before Editing

### Before changing models
- Read the relevant `sales/models/*.py` file.
- Check `sales/migrations/` for the highest migration and existing constraints (includes `NoQuoteCAGE` / `0018_no_quote_cage` or later).
- Search templates under `sales/templates/sales/` for field references — many field names appear in templates directly.
- Check `sales/services/bq_export.py` for `COMPANY_FILLED_COLUMNS` — it maps 1-based BQ column indices to exact model field names on `GovernmentBid` and `CompanyCAGE`.
- Check `sales/services/importer.py` for chunking constants (`SOLICITATION_CHUNK=200`, `LINE_CHUNK=230`, `AS_CHUNK=400`) and any field references in upsert logic.
- Check `sales/services/matching.py` — references `SupplierMatch.match_method`, `SupplierNSN.nsn`, `SupplierFSC.fsc_code`, `ApprovedSource.approved_cage` by name.

### Before changing views
- Read the full view module being changed (`sales/views/*.py`).
- `sales/views/awards.py` — upload enforces `request.user.is_staff`; do not remove that check. The result view pops `aw_import_result` from the session — do not change the session key name.
- Check `sales/urls.py` for the URL name being used — several names are duplicated (e.g., `bids/` and `bids/ready/` both point to `bids_ready`; `rfq/` and `rfq/pending/` both point to `rfq_pending`).
- Check templates for context variable names — the detail view passes `solicitation`, `lines`, `matches`, `rfqs`, `quotes`, `prev_sol`, `next_sol`, `list_qs`, `queued_rfq_count`, and other keys that templates depend on.
- Check `sales/context_processors.py` — adds `overdue_rfq_count` to every request.

### Before changing services
- `sales/services/bq_export.py` — any rename of `GovernmentBid` or `CompanyCAGE` fields listed in `COMPANY_FILLED_COLUMNS` will silently produce wrong BQ output (no attribute error, wrong column filled).
- `sales/services/matching.py` — the three tiers are interdependent; changing tier boundaries or deduplication logic affects bid quality downstream.
- `sales/services/email.py` — `_default_cage()` must always find exactly one `CompanyCAGE(is_default=True, is_active=True)`. If that invariant breaks, every RFQ email fails.
- `sales/services/importer.py` — step results stored in `ImportJob.step_results` as JSON must include `batch_id` and `import_date`; the progress template reads those keys by name.

### Before changing templates
- `sales/templates/sales/rfq/partials/mailto_buttons.html` — referenced from the RFQ pending view (solicitation detail Matches tab uses queue buttons + No Quote modals, not this partial).
- `sales/templates/sales/import/progress.html` — reads `step_results` JSON keys by name; must stay in sync with `_save_step` in `sales/views/imports.py`.
- `sales/templates/sales/bids/builder.html` — contains inline form field names tied to `GovernmentBid` fields; mismatch causes silent wrong saves.
- Check `sales/base.html` nav links before renaming any URL name.

### Before changing forms
- `ImportUploadForm` (`sales/forms.py`) is shared between `import_upload` and `import_fetch_dibbs` — changes affect both entry points.
- `QuoteEntryForm` is defined inside `sales/views/rfq.py` (not `forms.py`) — search there, not in `forms.py`.

---

## 4. Local Architecture / Change Patterns

**Business logic location:** Services (`sales/services/`). Views should orchestrate services, not contain logic. Do not add parsing, matching, or export logic directly into views.

**Validation:** Split across two patterns:
- `QuoteEntryForm` (inside `views/rfq.py`) — form-based Django validation.
- `bid_builder` view — manual sanitization and recalculation inline in the view function. There is no service layer for bid validation other than `bq_export.validate_bid_for_export`.

**Templates:** Server-rendered with minimal JS. The RFQ center (`rfq/center.html`) is AJAX-driven via fetch calls; its partial (`rfq/partials/center_panel.html`) is returned as HTML fragment. Most other views are full-page server renders.

**Status transitions:** Solicitation status is advanced explicitly in service calls (e.g., `send_rfq_email` advances to `RFQ_SENT`, quote entry advances to `QUOTING`). There are no signals or model-level `save()` hooks triggering transitions. Status flow must be managed manually wherever status changes occur.

**Admin:** `sales/admin.py` registers nothing. All staff actions go through custom views. Do not assume Django admin works for any sales model.

**Background processing:** None. Everything runs synchronously via HTTP. The five AJAX import steps are sequential HTTP POSTs, not background tasks.

## 5. Files That Commonly Need to Change Together

### Adding a new field to `GovernmentBid`
→ `sales/models/bids.py` + new migration + `sales/services/bq_export.py` (if it maps to a BQ column) + `sales/templates/sales/bids/builder.html` + `sales/views/bids.py` (bid_builder POST handling)

### Adding a new solicitation status
→ `sales/models/solicitations.py` (STATUS_CHOICES) + every view that checks that status string + `sales/templates/sales/solicitations/list.html` (filter dropdown) + `sales/templates/sales/solicitations/detail.html` (pipeline ribbon **and** status banner block for non–New/Matching statuses) + `sales/context_processors.py` if it affects overdue count logic

### Changing solicitation list tabs, filters, sort, or NO_BID visibility
→ `sales/views/solicitations.py` — keep `_list_qs_before_tab`, `_apply_list_tab_filter`, `_apply_list_sort`, and `_build_list_queryset` aligned with `solicitation_list()` so detail **Prev/Next** (`?list_qs=`) matches the list. Update `sales/templates/sales/solicitations/list.html` (tabs, `filter_snapshot` on row links) as needed.

### Adding a new match tier or method
→ `sales/services/matching.py` + `sales/models/matching.py` (MATCH_METHOD_CHOICES) + new migration + `sales/templates/sales/solicitations/detail.html` (matches tab) + `sales/templates/sales/rfq/partials/mailto_buttons.html`

### Changing `CompanyCAGE` fields
→ `sales/models/cages.py` + new migration + `sales/services/bq_export.py` (check `COMPANY_FILLED_COLUMNS`) + `sales/services/email.py` (`_default_cage()` and `_rfq_body()`) + `sales/views/settings.py` (cage add/edit form handling) + `sales/templates/sales/settings/cage_form.html`

### Changing `EmailTemplate` fields
→ `sales/models/email_templates.py` + new migration + `sales/services/email.py` (template rendering) + `sales/views/settings.py` + `sales/templates/sales/settings/email_template_form.html` + `sales/templates/sales/settings/email_templates.html`

### Adding a new import AJAX step
→ `sales/urls.py` + `sales/views/imports.py` + `sales/templates/sales/import/progress.html` (step checklist) + `sales/services/importer.py` if new service logic needed

### Changing `SupplierNSN` or `SupplierFSC` fields
→ `sales/models/suppliers.py` + new migration + `sales/services/matching.py` + `sales/views/suppliers.py` + `sales/templates/sales/suppliers/detail.html`

### Flagging or restoring a No Quote CAGE
→ `sales/models/no_quote.py` + migration + `sales/services/no_quote.py` + `sales/views/suppliers.py` + `sales/views/entity_lookup.py` + `sales/views/settings.py` + `sales/views/solicitations.py` + `sales/views/rfq.py` (batch send, queue add/send, `supplier_create_and_queue`) + `sales/templates/sales/suppliers/detail.html` + `sales/entity_lookup.html` + `sales/templates/sales/solicitations/detail.html` + `sales/templates/sales/rfq/pending.html` + `sales/base.html` / `sales/settings/cages.html` nav

---

## 6. Cross-App Dependency Warnings

### This app depends on:
- **`suppliers.Supplier`** (table: `contracts_supplier`) — every SupplierMatch, SupplierRFQ, SupplierQuote, SupplierContactLog, SupplierNSN, SupplierFSC, and GovernmentBid references it. Renaming or restructuring `Supplier` fields (`contact`, `primary_email`, `business_email`, `name`, `cage_code`) breaks `sales/services/email.py` (`_supplier_email()`), supplier list/detail views, and RFQ send flows.
- **`contracts.models.Clin`** — read in `sales/services/matching.py::backfill_nsn_from_contracts()`. If `Clin` fields change (especially nsn, supplier FK), this function breaks silently.
- **`auth.User`** — referenced as FK in `SupplierRFQ.sent_by`, `SupplierContactLog.logged_by`, `SupplierQuote.entered_by`, `EmailTemplate.created_by`. If `AUTH_USER_MODEL` changes or user fields are restructured, update these models.
- **`settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`** — used in `sales/services/email.py` for outbound email sender.
- **`settings.SAM_API_KEY`** and **`settings.SAM_OUR_CAGE`** — required by `sam_entity.py` and `sam_awards_sync.py`; missing values cause graceful degradation (awards sync skipped, entity lookup errors shown to user).

### Other apps that depend on this app:
- **`STATZWeb/settings.py`** — registers `sales.context_processors.rfq_counts` in `CONTEXT_PROCESSORS`. If this processor is renamed or its module path changes, the setting must be updated or a 500 error occurs on every page load.
- No other apps are known to import from `sales` directly. Run `grep -r "from sales" .` and `grep -r "import sales" .` to verify before refactoring public surfaces.

### URL namespace:
- The `sales:` namespace is used in templates across the app. Before renaming any URL name in `sales/urls.py`, search all templates under `sales/templates/` for `{% url 'sales:<name>' %}`.

---

## 7. Security / Permissions Rules

- **Every view must retain `@login_required`**. This app handles sensitive procurement data (solicitation numbers, supplier pricing, bid data). Do not remove or weaken auth decorators.
- **Staff-only endpoints:** `backfill_nsn` uses `@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_authenticated and u.is_staff)`. `sync_awards_view` and `awards_import_upload` check `request.user.is_staff`. `no_quote_list` and `no_quote_deactivate` require `is_staff`. Do not remove these checks or widen access.
- **SAM debug JSON** in `sales/templates/sales/entity_lookup.html` is conditionally shown only to staff (`{% if request.user.is_staff %}`). Do not remove this guard.
- **Import batch delete** (`import_batch_delete`) only deletes solicitations with `status='New'`. This guard prevents accidental deletion of in-progress work. Do not relax this filter.
- **File uploads** (IN/BQ/AS files) are saved to temp directories and removed during the match step. Do not change temp file handling without verifying cleanup still occurs.
- **RFQ mailto flows** generate `mailto:` URLs rather than sending email automatically. This is intentional — `rfq_mark_sent` requires the human to confirm the email was sent. Do not change this to auto-send without understanding the workflow.
- **`SupplierContactLog`** provides an audit trail for all RFQ communications. Do not remove or bypass log creation in `send_rfq_email` or `rfq_mark_sent`.

---

## 8. Model and Schema Change Rules

- **Before renaming any field** on `GovernmentBid` or `CompanyCAGE`, check `sales/services/bq_export.py::COMPANY_FILLED_COLUMNS`. This dict maps BQ column positions to field names using Python `getattr`. A rename will silently export empty/wrong columns with no Python error.
- **Before renaming `SolicitationLine.bq_raw_columns`**, check `sales/services/bq_export.py` — it reads this JSON field to get the 121-column original BQ row for overlay.
- **Before renaming `Solicitation.status` choices**, search all views and templates for hardcoded status strings (`'New'`, `'RFQ_SENT'`, `'BID_SUBMITTED'`, etc.). These appear as raw string comparisons in views and template conditionals.
- **`CompanyCAGE.is_default` invariant:** exactly one active default cage must exist at all times. The `settings_cage_add` and `settings_cage_edit` views enforce this by resetting all other cages to `is_default=False` when a new default is set. Any direct ORM manipulation must maintain this invariant.
- **`EmailTemplate.is_default` invariant:** same one-default constraint enforced in `email_template_set_default`. `sales/services/email.py` calls `EmailTemplate.objects.filter(is_default=True).first()` and fails gracefully if none found, but RFQ emails will have no template content.
- **SMTP credentials** are stored in environment variables (`EMAIL_HOST_USER`, `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`), not on `CompanyCAGE`. Do not add SMTP credential fields to the model. The `smtp_reply_to` field on `CompanyCAGE` holds only the Reply-To address, not auth credentials.
- **`from_email` on outbound mail must equal `EMAIL_HOST_USER`** exactly (via `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`, which is set from that env var). Microsoft 365 rejects sends where the authenticated account and the From address differ.
- **Cross-app FKs:** `SupplierNSN`, `SupplierFSC`, `SupplierMatch`, `SupplierRFQ`, `SupplierContactLog`, `SupplierQuote`, and `GovernmentBid` all have FKs to `suppliers.Supplier`. Changing `on_delete` behavior requires understanding impact on those cascades.
- **Migrations:** Run `makemigrations sales` after any model change and review the generated file before applying (schema includes `NoQuoteCAGE` from `0018_no_quote_cage` or later).

---

## 9. View / URL / Template Change Rules

- **URL names must not be renamed casually.** Templates reference them with `{% url 'sales:<name>' %}`. Before renaming, `grep -r "sales:<name>" sales/templates/` and check `sales/base.html` nav links.
- **Duplicate URL patterns exist by design:** `bids/` and `bids/ready/` both route to `bids_ready`; `rfq/` and `rfq/pending/` both route to `rfq_pending`. Do not clean these up without checking if both are in use from nav links or other templates.
- **`rfq/partials/center_panel.html`** is returned as an HTML fragment by `rfq_center_detail`. It must remain a partial (no `{% extends %}`) and its context keys must match what the view passes.
- **`rfq/partials/mailto_buttons.html`** is included from `rfq/pending.html` (solicitation detail Matches tab uses queue UI, not this partial).
- **Import progress page** (`import/progress.html`) reads `step_results` JSON keys by name. The keys `batch_id`, `import_date`, `solicitations_created`, `solicitations_updated`, `lines_created`, `lines_updated`, `matches_created` must be written by the corresponding view step functions.
- **`global_search` view** returns JSON when `?fmt=json` is present, plain HTML otherwise. The top-bar search in `sales/base.html` calls it with `fmt=json`. Do not remove the format check.
- **Solicitation list ↔ detail navigation:** The list encodes active filters (except `page`) into `?list_qs=` on each row’s detail link. `solicitation_detail` parses `list_qs` and uses `_build_list_queryset()` to compute `prev_sol` / `next_sol`. Any drift between list view filtering and `_build_list_queryset` breaks prev/next; `queued_rfq_count` for banners uses `SupplierRFQ` filtered by `line__solicitation` and `status='QUEUED'` (not a `Solicitation` reverse relation).
- **Context processor dependency:** `overdue_rfq_count` is available in every template because `sales.context_processors.rfq_counts` is registered in settings. Do not remove `rfq_counts` without updating `STATZWeb/settings.py`.

---

## 10. Forms / Serializers / Input Validation Rules

- **`QuoteEntryForm` is in `sales/views/rfq.py`**, not `sales/forms.py`. This is non-standard. Search there when debugging quote validation issues.
- **`ImportUploadForm`** (`sales/forms.py`) is used by both `import_upload` and `import_fetch_dibbs`. Changes to required fields affect both flows.
- **Bid builder validation** is inline in the `bid_builder` view (POST branch), not in a dedicated form class. `bq_export.validate_bid_for_export()` provides a second validation pass at export time. Validation that passes bid builder but fails `validate_bid_for_export` will let a user save a DRAFT that cannot be exported.
- **NSN normalization:** `supplier_add_nsn` strips hyphens and enforces 13 characters. If this is changed, update `matching.py::_normalize_nsn()` to stay consistent.
- **FSC normalization:** `supplier_add_fsc` enforces exactly 4 uppercase characters. Changing this must stay consistent with `parser.py` FSC field extraction and `matching.py` tier 3 logic.
- **CAGE code length:** 5 characters, enforced in bid builder, bq_export validation, and model `max_length`. Keep all three consistent.

---

## 11. Background Tasks / Signals / Automation Rules

**No signals.** No Celery tasks. No scheduled jobs. No async processing.

**The import pipeline is fully synchronous via five sequential AJAX HTTP POSTs:**
1. `import_step_parse` → parse files
2. `import_step_solicitations` → upsert Solicitation rows
3. `import_step_lines` → upsert SolicitationLine + ApprovedSource rows
4. `import_step_match` → run matching engine
5. `import_step_awards` → sync SAM.gov awards

Each step updates `ImportJob.status` and `ImportJob.step_results`. The progress page polls these. If a step fails, `ImportJob.status` is set to `'error'` and the message is stored in `ImportJob.error_message`.

**Awards sync** (`sync_awards_view` and step 5) calls SAM.gov and is expected to sometimes fail. Failures are logged but do not abort the import.

**DIBBS fetch** (`import_fetch_dibbs`) requires Playwright + Chromium. If not installed, it will raise `DibbsFetchError`. This is a known gap with no fallback.

---

## 12. Testing and Verification Expectations

**There are no automated tests.** `sales/tests.py` contains only the default Django stub.

After any change, manually verify these flows:

| Change area | Verify manually |
|---|---|
| Import pipeline | Upload IN/BQ/AS files, step through progress page, confirm batch and solicitation counts |
| Matching logic | Check solicitation detail → matches tab for expected suppliers and tiers |
| RFQ send | Click mailto button, confirm `rfq_mark_sent` creates `SupplierRFQ` and `SupplierContactLog` |
| Quote entry | Open `rfq/<id>/quote/`, submit a quote, confirm `SupplierQuote` created and solicitation moves to QUOTING |
| Bid builder | Open `bids/<sol_number>/build/`, save draft, mark ready, confirm `GovernmentBid` created |
| BQ export | Open `bids/export/`, select bids, download file, open CSV and verify column 6 = quoter CAGE |
| CompanyCAGE default | Edit settings, set a new default, confirm only one cage has `is_default=True` |
| Email template | Set a template as default, trigger an RFQ, confirm template content appears in mailto body |
| Status context badge | Verify `overdue_rfq_count` badge appears correctly in nav after sending an RFQ with an expired return date |
| Solicitation list / detail nav | Open list with filters and sort; open a row; confirm Back/Prev/Next and status banners; confirm No-Bid tab only shows `NO_BID` and other tabs exclude it |

**High-risk files to test after any change:** `sales/services/bq_export.py`, `sales/services/matching.py`, `sales/services/importer.py`, `sales/views/rfq.py`, `sales/views/bids.py`.

---

## 13. Known Footguns

1. **`COMPANY_FILLED_COLUMNS` silent failures.** Renaming any field on `GovernmentBid` or `CompanyCAGE` that appears in the `bq_export.py` mapping will not raise an exception — `getattr` returns an empty string or `None`, and the exported BQ file will quietly contain wrong data.

2. **`_default_cage()` single point of failure.** Every RFQ email and every BQ export depends on exactly one `CompanyCAGE(is_default=True, is_active=True)` existing. Deleting or deactivating that record without setting a new default causes all email and export operations to fail at runtime.

3. **Hardcoded status strings.** Solicitation status values like `'New'`, `'RFQ_SENT'`, `'BID_SUBMITTED'` appear as raw strings in views, templates, and services — not imported from a constants module. Renaming a choice value in `STATUS_CHOICES` without a global search-and-replace will break filters, transitions, and template conditionals silently.

4. **`QuoteEntryForm` not in `forms.py`.** It is defined inline in `sales/views/rfq.py`. Searching `forms.py` for quote validation will find nothing.

5. **`rfq/partials/mailto_buttons.html` is used on RFQ pending.** The solicitation detail Matches tab does not include it; queue + No Quote UI lives inline in `solicitations/detail.html`.

6. **`step_results` JSON keys are implicit contracts.** The import progress template reads specific keys from `ImportJob.step_results` by name. If a step function stops writing a key (e.g., renames `solicitations_created` to `created_count`), the progress page will silently show blank or "undefined" without any Python error.

7. **`item_type_indicator == '2'` skips NSN matching.** In `matching.py`, lines with `item_type_indicator='2'` skip tiers 1 and 2 and go straight to FSC (tier 3) or manual match. This behavior is implicit in the code; adding a tier without accounting for this indicator will apply it to wrong line types.

8. **Playwright dependency with no fallback.** `import_fetch_dibbs` fails completely if Playwright/Chromium is not installed. The error is surfaced to the user as a `DibbsFetchError`, but there is no indication in the UI that it requires a browser binary.

9. **`import_batch_delete` only removes `status='New'` solicitations.** This is intentional but could confuse an agent expecting full batch cleanup. Solicitations that have been triaged, matched, or bid will remain even after the batch is deleted.

10. **`bq_raw_columns` null causes `BQExportError`.** If a `SolicitationLine.bq_raw_columns` is `None` or empty (e.g., from a hand-created line or a migration gap), export will raise `BQExportError` with no easy recovery path.

11. **`_build_list_queryset` vs `solicitation_list` drift.** If list filters or ordering change in one place but not the other, users see wrong Prev/Next order or missing neighbors. Treat `_list_qs_before_tab`, `_apply_list_tab_filter`, and `_apply_list_sort` as part of the same contract as the list template’s `filter_snapshot`.

12. **`get_no_quote_cage_set()` is fetched once per page load.** The set is built at render time for solicitation detail and RFQ pending, not per row. If a CAGE is flagged in another tab, an already-open detail page will not show the badge until refresh — expected.

---

## 14. Safe Change Workflow

1. **Read `sales/CONTEXT.md`** for domain background.
2. **Read the specific model/service/view files** directly involved — do not rely on CONTEXT.md alone for field names.
3. **Search for cross-file dependencies** before any rename:
   - Field renames: search `sales/services/`, `sales/views/`, `sales/templates/` for the field name.
   - URL name changes: `grep -r "sales:<name>" sales/templates/` and `sales/base.html`.
   - Status string changes: `grep -r "'<STATUS>'" sales/` (views, services, templates all use raw strings).
4. **Check cross-app impact**: `suppliers.Supplier` field references in `sales/services/email.py`, `matching.py`, `views/suppliers.py`; `contracts.Clin` in `matching.backfill_nsn_from_contracts`.
5. **Make minimal, scoped changes.** Do not refactor adjacent code unless it is directly broken.
6. **Update all coupled files** (see Section 5 clusters).
7. **Run `makemigrations sales`** if any model was changed and review the output.
8. **Verify manually** using the flows in Section 12 relevant to your change.
9. **Do not push** without confirming the BQ export still produces valid 121-column output if any model or export code was touched.

## 15. Quick Reference

### Primary files to inspect first
- `sales/models/` (all files — schema is the source of truth)
- `sales/services/bq_export.py` — governs the critical BQ export path
- `sales/services/matching.py` — governs supplier match quality
- `sales/services/email.py` — governs RFQ dispatch
- `sales/services/importer.py` — governs import pipeline
- `sales/views/rfq.py` — largest and most complex view module
- `sales/views/bids.py` — bid builder + export orchestration
- `sales/views/solicitations.py` — list/detail; shared queryset helpers for list + `list_qs` prev/next
- `sales/urls.py` — URL names used throughout templates

### Main coupled areas
- `GovernmentBid` fields ↔ `bq_export.COMPANY_FILLED_COLUMNS`
- `SolicitationLine.bq_raw_columns` ↔ BQ export overlay logic
- `ImportJob.step_results` keys ↔ `import/progress.html`
- `CompanyCAGE.is_default` ↔ every RFQ and BQ export
- `rfq/partials/mailto_buttons.html` ↔ solicitation detail + RFQ pending

### Main cross-app dependencies
- `suppliers.Supplier` — central supplier record; all matching, RFQ, quote, and bid FKs point here
- `contracts.models.Clin` — read by `backfill_nsn_from_contracts()`
- `sales.context_processors.rfq_counts` registered in `STATZWeb/settings.py`

### Main security-sensitive areas
- All views — must retain `@login_required`
- `backfill_nsn`, `sync_awards_view` — must retain staff-only guards
- SAM debug JSON — must remain staff-only in `entity_lookup.html`
- `import_batch_delete` — must retain `status='New'` filter

### Riskiest edit types
1. Renaming fields on `GovernmentBid` or `CompanyCAGE` (silent BQ export corruption)
2. Changing `Solicitation.STATUS_CHOICES` values (hardcoded string references everywhere)
3. Touching `sales/services/matching.py` tier logic (affects all downstream bid quality)
4. Removing or restructuring the `CompanyCAGE.is_default` constraint (breaks all RFQ and export flows)
5. Renaming URL patterns in `sales/urls.py` (breaks template `{% url %}` tags silently)
