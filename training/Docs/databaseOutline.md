**Part 1 Models: Laying the Foundation for Required Training**

The models in Part 1 are designed to define the core structure for managing required training based on user account types.

1.  **`Course` Model:**
    * **Purpose:** This model represents individual training courses. It stores basic information about each course.
    * **Fields:**
        * `name` (`CharField`): The name of the training course (e.g., "Security Awareness Training", "Data Handling Best Practices").
        * `link` (`URLField`, optional): A URL where users can access the training material online. This can be blank or null if the training doesn't have a direct online link.
        * `description` (`TextField`, optional): A more detailed description of the course content. This can also be blank or null.
    * **Flow into Views and Templates:**
        * **Views:** In the admin interface (which Django provides automatically), you'll use views to create, read, update, and delete `Course` objects. You might also create custom views to display lists of available courses to administrators.
        * **Templates:** Admin templates will be used for managing `Course` objects. If you build custom user interfaces, you'll create templates to display course names, links, and descriptions.

2.  **`Account` Model:**
    * **Purpose:** This model defines different types of user accounts within your system. It uses a `CharField` with `choices` to ensure a predefined set of account types.
    * **Fields:**
        * `type` (`CharField` with `choices`, `unique=True`): The type of user account (e.g., "System Administrators", "CUI Users"). The `choices` parameter restricts the possible values to the `ACCOUNT_TYPE_CHOICES` list, ensuring data consistency. `unique=True` ensures that each account type is distinct.
        * `description` (`TextField`, optional): A description of the responsibilities or characteristics of this account type.
    * **Flow into Views and Templates:**
        * **Views:** Similar to `Course`, admin views will handle CRUD operations for `Account` objects. You might use these in custom forms to assign account types to users.
        * **Templates:** Admin templates will be used here. In user-facing templates, you might display a user's account type.

3.  **`Matrix` Model:**
    * **Purpose:** This model establishes the relationship between training courses and account types, defining which courses are required for which types of users and how often.
    * **Fields:**
        * `course` (`ForeignKey` to `Course`, `on_delete=models.CASCADE`): Links a specific training course to this matrix entry. If a `Course` is deleted, all associated `Matrix` entries will also be deleted.
        * `account` (`ForeignKey` to `Account`, `on_delete=models.CASCADE`): Links a specific account type to this matrix entry. If an `Account` is deleted, related `Matrix` entries are also deleted.
        * `frequency` (`CharField` with `choices`, optional): Specifies how often the training is required (e.g., "Annually", "Once"). The `choices` provide a controlled list of frequencies.
    * **Flow into Views and Templates:**
        * **Views:** Admin views will be crucial for managing the training matrix – creating entries that link courses to accounts and set frequencies. Custom views will likely be needed to determine the required training for a specific user based on their account type.
        * **Templates:** Admin templates will be used to manage the matrix. User-facing templates will display the list of required training for the logged-in user, potentially filtered based on their account type.

4.  **`Tracker` Model:**
    * **Purpose:** This model records when a user completes a specific training course defined in the `Matrix`. It allows for tracking the history of completions and storing associated documents.
    * **Fields:**
        * `user` (`ForeignKey` to `User`, `on_delete=models.CASCADE`): Links the completion record to a specific user.
        * `matrix` (`ForeignKey` to `Matrix`, `on_delete=models.CASCADE`): Links the completion record to a specific course requirement defined in the `Matrix`.
        * `completed_date` (`DateField`, `default=timezone.now`): The date when the user marked the training as complete. It defaults to the current date and time when a new record is created.
        * `document` (`BinaryField`, optional): Stores the content of any uploaded document related to the training completion directly in the database.
        * `document_name` (`CharField`, optional): Stores the original filename of the uploaded document.
    * **Properties:**
        * `expiration_date` (`@property`): Calculates the expiration date of the training based on the `frequency` defined in the related `Matrix` record.
    * **Meta:**
        * `ordering = ['-completed_date']`: Ensures that when querying `Tracker` records, they are ordered by the most recent completion date first.
    * **Flow into Views and Templates:**
        * **Views:** Views will handle the process of users marking training as complete, uploading documents, and saving new `Tracker` records. Views will also be needed to retrieve and display a user's training history and their current required training status (considering completion dates and frequencies).
        * **Templates:** User-facing templates will display the list of completed training, the completion dates, and potentially links to download uploaded documents. Admin views might use templates to review overall training progress.

**Part 2 Models: Handling Arctic Wolf Specific Training**

The models in Part 2 are tailored to the specific requirements of tracking Arctic Wolf training, where a unique link will be associated with each course.

1.  **`ArcticWolfCourse` Model:**
    * **Purpose:** This model represents specific Arctic Wolf training modules.
    * **Fields:**
        * `name` (`CharField`, `max_length=255`, `unique=True`): The name of the Arctic Wolf training course. The `unique=True` constraint suggests that each Arctic Wolf training should have a distinct name.
        * `description` (`TextField`, optional): A description of the course.
        * `course_id` (`UUIDField`, `default=uuid.uuid4`, `editable=False`, `unique=True`): A unique, unguessable identifier for this specific Arctic Wolf course. This `UUID` will be used in the unique completion link.
    * **Flow into Views and Templates:**
        * **Views:** Admin views will manage the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of `ArcticWolfCourse` objects. Custom views will be needed to handle the unique completion links and the logic when a user accesses them.
        * **Templates:** Admin templates will be used for management. User-facing templates will be displayed when a user clicks the completion link, showing the course name and a way to mark it as complete (if not already done).

2.  **`ArcticWolfCompletion` Model:**
    * **Purpose:** This model tracks when a specific user completes an Arctic Wolf training course.
    * **Fields:**
        * `user` (`ForeignKey` to `User`, `on_delete=models.CASCADE`): Links the completion record to a user.
        * `course` (`ForeignKey` to `ArcticWolfCourse`, `on_delete=models.CASCADE`): Links the completion record to a specific Arctic Wolf course.
        * `completed_date` (`DateField`, optional): The date when the user completed the training. This can be null if the training is not yet completed.
    * **Meta:**
        * `unique_together = ('user', 'course')`: Ensures that a user cannot have multiple completion records for the same Arctic Wolf course.
    * **Flow into Views and Templates:**
        * **Views:** Views will be responsible for creating `ArcticWolfCompletion` records when a user marks a course as complete via the unique link. They will also need to check if a completion record already exists.
        * **Templates:** Templates will be used to display confirmation messages upon completion or to indicate that the training is already completed.

**In Summary:**

The models act as the blueprint for your database, defining the types of data you'll store and the relationships between them.

* **Part 1** focuses on defining the *requirements* for training based on account types and tracking individual user *completions* of those requirements, including the history and potential expiration.
* **Part 2** focuses on a specific type of training (Arctic Wolf) that utilizes unique links for completion tracking.

The views will contain the business logic to interact with these models – to retrieve data, create new records, update existing ones, and perform calculations (like determining required training or expiration dates).

The templates will handle the presentation of this data to the users, displaying lists of courses, completion statuses, forms for marking completion, and any necessary feedback or messages.

As we move forward, we'll see how these models are used within the views to fetch and manipulate data, and how the templates are used to present that information in a user-friendly way. Let me know if you have any specific questions about how a particular model or field will be used in the views or templates!
