## Training Application Write-up

**Objective:** The `training` application helps track what training each user needs to take, when they last took that training, and stores any documents that training may produce. The application supports both CMMC compliance training and Arctic Wolf security awareness training.

**Key Components:**

1. **Models:**
   * Located in `training/models.py`
   * Tables:
     Part 1 - CMMC Training:
     * `Course` (name, link, description) - Represents training courses like AUP, AUP-System Admin, Access Control Plan, etc.
     * `Account` (type, description) - Defines user types (System Administrators, CUI Users, NON CUI Users, SSO, ISO, IO, External/Temp Users)
     * `Matrix` (FK course, FK account, frequency) - Links courses to account types with frequency requirements
     * `Tracker` (FK users, FK matrix, completed_date, document, document_name) - Tracks user completion and stores completion documents
     * `UserAccount` - Links users to their account types
     
     Part 2 - Arctic Wolf Training:
     * `ArcticWolfCourse` (name, description, course_id, slug) - Represents Arctic Wolf training courses
     * `ArcticWolfCompletion` (FK user, FK course, completed_date) - Tracks completion of Arctic Wolf training

2. **Views and Templates:**
   Part 1 - CMMC Training Management:
   * Dashboard (`/training/`) - Overview of training status and admin actions
   * Training Matrix Management (`/training/matrix/manage/`) - Admin interface to configure required training by account type
   * User Requirements (`/training/requirements/`) - Shows users their required training with completion status
   * Training Audit (`/training/audit/`) - Admin view of all users' training completion status
   * Document Upload/View functionality for training completion records
   
   Part 2 - Arctic Wolf Training:
   * Arctic Wolf Course Management (`/training/arctic-wolf/add/`, `/training/arctic-wolf/list/`)
   * Training Completion via unique links (`/training/arctic-wolf/complete/<slug>/`)
   * Arctic Wolf Audit (`/training/arctic-wolf/audit/`) - Shows completion status across all users
   * User's Arctic Wolf Courses (`/training/my-courses/`) - Personal view of assigned courses

3. **Core Features:**
   * Role-based training requirements through the Matrix system
   * Document upload and storage for training completion records
   * Unique completion links for Arctic Wolf training
   * Comprehensive audit trails for both training types
   * Automated tracking of completion dates and frequencies
   * Staff-only administrative functions
   * Modern UI with Tailwind CSS styling

4. **Technical Implementation:**
   * Built on Django's MVT architecture
   * Uses Django's built-in authentication system
   * Implements form styling rules for consistent UI
   * AJAX for smooth user interactions
   * Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
   * Secure document storage and retrieval
   * URL-based completion tracking for Arctic Wolf training

5. **User Interface Features:**
   * Dashboard with training completion statistics
   * Interactive training matrix management
   * Document upload/download capabilities
   * Completion status indicators
   * Rotated headers in audit views for better readability
   * Copy-to-clipboard functionality for Arctic Wolf training links
   * Mobile-responsive design

6. **Security Features:**
   * Login protection for all views
   * Role-based access control
   * Secure document storage
   * Unique, unguessable training completion URLs
   * CSRF protection
   * Staff-only administrative functions

The application successfully implements all planned features from the initial write-up and includes additional functionality for better user experience and administration. It maintains a clear separation between CMMC compliance training and Arctic Wolf security awareness training while providing a unified interface for users and administrators.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Model (``):**
    *   Located in `training/models.py`.
    *   Tables:
    Part 1
        *   course (name, link, desctiption) (Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), AUP-System Admin, Access Contro Plan, ect)
        *   account (type, description) - (System Administrators, CUI Users, NON CUI Users, SSO, ISO, Information Owner (IO), External/Temp Users)
        *   matrix (FK course, fk account, Frequincy)
        *   tracker (fk users, fk matrix)
    Part 2
        *   Arctic Wolf Traning completion signing sheets

2.  **Forms/Views/Templateds
    Part 1
        * We'll need a form to add courses, add account types, and be able to create a matrix the associates what account types need to take which courses and how offten. For simplisity this can be all one administration page.
        * We'll want a way to track the users and what courses they need to take baised of the account type we assign them.
        * We'll need a way for the user to be able to See the traning they need. Provide them a link to get to that training and a way to mark that they have completed the training and a way to upload the documents that the training might provide.
        * We'll need an audit page that shows all the user all the training they require, if complete show the date and have the date a link to the uploaded document.
        ** EXAMPLE **
        Trainning                       AUP 	    AUP-Admin       ACP         DOD Training
        EMPLOYEE					
        Mark Lyons	    CUI User	    1/1/2025                    1/1/2025    
        Chad Fuller	    CUI User				    1/1/2025        1/1/2025
        Barbra Pearsall	CUI User		1/1/2025	1/1/2025        1/1/2025
        Jen Cutsinger	CUI User		1/1/2025		            1/1/2025
        Erica Norman	CUI User				    1/1/2025        1/1/2025
        Jenifer Nolan	CUI User		1/1/2025	1/1/2025	    1/1/2025
        Cori McNicol	CUI User				    1/1/2025        1/1/2025
        Dion Mani	    CUI User		1/1/2025		            1/1/2025
        ** END EXAMPLE **

    Part 2
        * We will want a way to Add a new Arctic wolf Training. and have it create an API link that we can add to an email and when the user clicks the email they see a page with the Arctic Wolf Training Name with a button saying Traning Complete.  When the button is click we sae that user info to the database and they see training complete and they date time they clicked the button.  If the User clicks the button from there email a second time to the API the system is smart enough to know they they already clicked that they completed that training and just shows them the completed information.
        * We'll want an audit page to show all active users and the trainings they have completed and when and the ones they may be missing.  So maybe Users across the top with a virtical list of Arctic Wolf Trainings, and the table filled with completion dates.
        ** EXAMPLE **
        Course          Dion        Jenny       Mark
        Course 1 Name   1/1/2025    1/1/2025    1/1/2025
        Course 2 Name   2/5/2025    2/6/2025    2/5/2025
        Course 3 Nam3   3/3/2025    3/1/2025    3/2/2025
        ** END EXAMPLE **

3.  **Urls
    * Urls nessisary to achieve our goals

**Core Processes:**

1.  Track all types of training needed to maintain CMMC Compliance.
2.  Track all training issues by Arctic Wolf for Security Awareness.
3.  Still use the Base_template.html as its base and then a Training_base to add a menu for the training that is required.
4.  


The application uses modern web technologies including:
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- AJAX for smooth user interactions
- Autocomplete for improved data entry
- Conditional login protection for secure access
- Modern modal dialogs for confirmations 


BUILD Process
Hello! I'm your coding partner, ready to help you build your Django training application. I can assist with tasks like writing code, debugging, and explaining Python and Django concepts. For example, I can help you create models, define views, or design URL patterns.

It sounds like you have a well-defined plan for your training application. I've reviewed the attached write-up, and it looks like a great project. To get started, let's break down the development process into manageable steps.

Here's an overview of how we can approach this:

1.  **Project Setup:**
    x Create the Django application (`training`).
    X Define the models in `models.py` (course, account, matrix, tracker, and Arctic Wolf training).
    x Set up the database and register the application.

2.  **Part 1 Functionality:**
    X Create forms to add courses, account types, and create the training matrix.
    x Develop views and templates for the admin page to manage these forms.
    x Implement logic to track user training requirements based on account type.
    x Build views and templates for users to see their required training, mark completion, and upload documents.
    x Create an audit page to display training completion status for all users.

3.  **Part 2 Functionality:**
    x Implement functionality to add Arctic Wolf training and generate API links.
    x Develop views to handle the API links, record training completion, and display confirmation.
    x Create an audit page for Arctic Wolf training completion.

4.  **URLs and Templates:**
    x Define all necessary URLs for the application.
    x Design templates, extending `base_template.html` and using a `training_base.html` for the training app's specific layout.

5.  **Additional Features:**
    * Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling.
    * Implement AJAX for interactive elements.
    * Incorporate autocomplete for forms.
    * Set up conditional login protection.
    * Use modern modal dialogs for confirmations.




When you create a new ArcticWolfCourse, it will automatically get a unique course_id. The URL for users to access the course and mark it as complete would look something like:

yourdomain.com/training/arcticwolf/complete/<course_id>/
When a user clicks this link:

Your Django view will receive the course_id.
The view will identify the ArcticWolfCourse based on this course_id.
The view will then need to determine the logged-in user (we'll handle authentication later).
It will check if a ArcticWolfCompletion record already exists for that user and that course.
If not, it will present a way for the user to mark the course as complete (perhaps a button). Upon submission, a new ArcticWolfCompletion record will be created with the current date.
If a completion record already exists, it will display a message indicating that the course has already been completed.
