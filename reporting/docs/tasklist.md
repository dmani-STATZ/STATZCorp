    Handle different data types (e.g., dates, numbers, strings).

    Implement more complex filter logic (e.g., AND/OR combinations).  You might need to use Q objects for this.  Consider using a JSONField in the model and building the queries dynamically.

    Update the form and view from Tasks 3 and 6.

    Implementation Notes:
    - Enhanced filter functionality in report_creation.html with a dedicated filter builder section
    - Added comprehensive operator support in the UI:

    Implementation Notes:
    - Enhanced ReportCreationForm with dynamic field updates:
      * Added AJAX endpoints for field fetching
      * Implemented relationship detection between tables
      * Added automatic linking table detection
      * Enhanced field type detection for proper filtering
    - Improved JavaScript functionality in report_creation.js:

* **Task 10: Totals and Subtotals (Basic)** ✓

    ✓ Add fields to the SavedReport model to store information about desired aggregations (e.g., aggregations as a JSONField).

    ✓ Update the form to allow users to specify which fields they want totals/subtotals for and what type of aggregation (sum, average, etc.).

    ✓ Modify the report view to perform the aggregations using Django's aggregation functions (Sum, Avg, etc.).

    ✓ Display the totals in the report template.

    - Enhanced report creation form with comprehensive aggregation UI:
      * Added field selection for aggregation with type detection
      * Implemented aggregation type selection (sum, avg, min, max, count)
      * Added custom label support for each aggregation
      * Added validation for aggregation configurations
    - Updated ReportDisplayView to handle aggregations:
      * Implemented proper aggregation calculation with relationship handling
      * Added support for multiple aggregation types
      * Enhanced error handling and logging
      * Added proper field path mapping for related tables
    - Enhanced report display template:
      * Added aggregation results section with responsive design

    Deliverable: Basic totals functionality with support for multiple aggregation types and proper handling of related fields.

* **Task 11: Subtotals Grouping** (Next Task)

    This task will implement what you're looking for:
    - Grouping by fields like Supplier Name
    - Calculating totals within each group
    - Displaying hierarchical data with subtotals
    - Supporting multiple grouping levels

    Extend the totals/subtotals functionality to support grouping for subtotals.

    Update the SavedReport model and form to allow users to specify grouping fields.

    Modify the report view to use annotate() and values() to group the data and calculate subtotals.

    Update the template to display the grouped data and subtotals.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**

* **Task 12: User Interface Polish**

    Improve the user interface using CSS and potentially a front-end framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind, React).

    Make the forms more user-friendly.

    Style the report table.

    Add pagination to the report view for large datasets.

    Deliverable: A polished and user-friendly interface.

* **Task 13: Permissions and Security**

    Implement proper permissions to ensure that users can only access and modify their own reports.

    Sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection).

    Deliverable: Secure application with proper permissions.

Notes:

Dynamic Forms: For the field selection, you'll likely need to use JavaScript to make the form dynamic. When a user selects a model, you can use an AJAX request to fetch the available fields for that model from the server and update the form.

Filtering: Start with simple filtering (e.g., exact matches) and then gradually add more complex filtering options. Consider using Django's Q objects for complex queries.

JSONField: Using a JSONField (if you're using PostgreSQL) or a TextField to store serialized data (e.g., as JSON) for the filters and selected_fields can provide more flexibility for complex data structures.

Pagination: For reports with large amounts of data, implement pagination to improve performance and user experience.  Django has built-in pagination tools.

Front-end Framework: Consider using a front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular for a more dynamic and interactive user interface, especially for the form and the report display.  This would change the nature of some of the tasks (you'd have a Django REST API and a separate front-end).

This task list provides a roadmap for developing your reporting app in Django. Remember to break down each task into smaller, more manageable steps as you work on them. Good luck!
