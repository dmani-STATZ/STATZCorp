FAR 52.209-10   PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH INVERTED DOMESTIC CORPORATIONS (NOV 2015);  
 
E05 Product Verification Testing (MAY 2020)  
(1) Product verification testing (PVT) under this procurement note will only apply when the contracting officer 
specifically invokes it in writing. The contracting officer may invoke PVT at or after contract award. If the 
contracting officer invokes PVT at contract award, the contract will explicitly state this testing requirement. If the 
contracting officer invokes PVT after contract award, the contracting officer shall notify the contractor and the 
cognizant DCMA ACO. The Government will perform PVT testing at a Government-designated testing laboratory.  
(2) The contractor shall not ship or deliver any material until it receives notification of the acceptable PVT 
results, unless the contracting officer directs it to do so in writing The Government will provide the PVT results to 
the contractor within 20 business days after receipt at the Government testing facility, unless the Government 
specifies otherwise in writing.  
(3) The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government in accordance with FAR 
Clause 52.246-2 or 52.246-3; and maintain and make available all records evidencing those details if requested by the 
Government. When the Government finds evidence of risk associated with the contractor’s sampling process, the 
Government may witness and evaluate the contractors sampling process. The contractor shall randomly select samples 
from the production lot(s), unless the contracting officer specifies otherwise in writing. The contractor shall ship 
the selected PVT samples with a copy of the system of record receiving report (i.e., WAWF, DD Form 250, or commercial 
shipping document) and the contractor’s signed DD Form 1222. The contractor shall prepare the shipping container(s) by 
marking the external packages in bold letters, Product Verification Test Samples  Do Not Post to Stock," Contract 
Number: (contractor insert) and Lot/Item Number: (contractor insert) adjacent to the MIL-STD-129 (latest revision) 
identification markings. The contractor shall use a hard copy of the system of record receiving report as a packing 
list, in accordance with DFARS Appendix F. The contractor shall mark the exterior of the shipping container in 
accordance with MIL-STD- 129 (latest revision), paragraph 5.11. The contractor shall send samples by traceable means 
(e.g., certified or registered mail, United Parcel Service, Federal Express). The contractor shall include the 
following in the interior package:  
(a) Hard copies of the contract;  
(b) Material certifications/process operation sheets; and  
(c) Drawings used to manufacture the units and return shipping information.  
(4) The Government will return samples that pass testing and are not destroyed during evaluation to the contractor at 
the Government expense for the contractor to include as part of the total contract quantity to be delivered under the 
contract. The contractor and Government may agree to dispose of samples not destroyed when the cost of the item does 
not justify the shipping expense. If the Government does not return approved samples that pass testing to the 
contractor, the Government will consider those samples as part of the contract quantity for payment and delivery.  
(5) If samples fail testing, the Government may reject the entire contract lot from which the contractor took the 
samples. The Government may, at its discretion, retain samples that fail testing without obligation to the contractor.

***THE FOLLOWING CLASS DEVIATION SUPERSEDES ANY PRIOR VERSION OF DFARS CLAUSE 252.204-7012.*** 
 
252.204-7012 SAFEGUARDING COVERED DEFENSE INFORMATION AND CYBER INCIDENT  REPORTING (MAY 2024) (DEVIATION 2024-O0013) 
(a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause Adequate security means protective measures that are commensurate with the 
consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to, or modification of information. Compromise 
means disclosure of information to unauthorized persons, or a violation of the security policy of a system, in which 
unauthorized intentional or unintentional disclosure, modification, destruction, or loss of an object, or the copying 
of information to unauthorized media may have occurred. Contractor attributional/proprietary information means 
information that identifies the contractor(s), whether directly or indirectly, by the grouping of information that can 
be traced back to the contractor(s) (e.g., program description, facility locations), personally identifiable 
information, as well as trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially sensitive 
information that is not customarily shared outside of the company. Controlled technical information means technical 
information with military or space application that is subject to controls on the access, use, reproduction, 
modification, performance, display, release, disclosure, or dissemination.  Controlled technical information would 
meet the criteria, if disseminated, for distribution statements B through F using the criteria set forth in DoD 
Instruction 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents.  The term does not include information that is 
lawfully publicly available without restrictions. Covered contractor information system means an unclassified 
information system that is owned, or operated by or for, a contractor and that processes, stores, or transmits covered 
defense information. Covered defense information means unclassified controlled technical information or other 
information, as described in the Registry at http://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category-list.html, that requires 
safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Governmentwide policies, 
and is 
(1)  Marked or otherwise identified in the contract, task order, or delivery order and provided to the contractor by 
or on behalf of DoD in support of the performance of the contract; or 
(2)  Collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on behalf of the contractor in support of the 
performance of the contract. Cyber incident means actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in a 
compromise or an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system and/or the information residing 
therein. Forensic analysis means the practice of gathering, retaining, and analyzing computer-related data for 
investigative purposes in a manner that maintains the integrity of the data. Information system means a discrete set 
of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or 
disposition of information. Malicious software means computer software or firmware intended to perform an unauthorized 
process that will have adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system.  
This definition includes a virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entity that infects a host, as well as 
spyware and some forms of adware. Media means physical devices or writing surfaces including, but is not limited to, 
magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, large-scale integration memory chips, and printouts onto which covered 
defense information is recorded, stored, or printed within a covered contractor information system. Operationally 
critical support means supplies or services designated by the Government as critical for airlift, sealift, intermodal 
transportation services, or logistical support that is essential to the mobilization, deployment, or sustainment of

the Armed Forces in a contingency operation. Rapidly report means within 72 hours of discovery of any cyber incident. 
Technical information means technical data or computer software, as those terms are defined in the clause at DFARS 
252.227-7013, Rights in Technical DataOther Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, regardless of whether or 
not the clause is incorporated in this solicitation or contract.  Examples of technical information include research 
and engineering data, engineering drawings, and associated lists, specifications, standards, process sheets, manuals, 
technical reports, technical orders, catalog-item identifications, data sets, studies and analyses and related 
information, and computer software executable code and source code. 
(b)  Adequate security.  The Contractor shall provide adequate security on all covered contractor information systems. 
To provide adequate security, the Contractor shall implement, at a minimum, the following information security 
protections: 
(1)  For covered contractor information systems that are part of an Information Technology (IT) service or system 
operated on behalf of the Government, the following security requirements apply: 
(i)  Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security requirements specified in the clause 252.239-7010, 
Cloud Computing Services, of this contract. 
(ii)  Any other such IT service or system (i.e., other than cloud computing) shall be subject to the security 
requirements specified elsewhere in this contract. 
(2)  For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service or system operated on behalf of the 
Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the 
following security requirements apply: 
(i)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be 
subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 
800-171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems  and Organizations, Revision 
2 (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171). 
(ii)(A)  The Contractor shall implement NIST SP 800-171, as soon as practical, but not later than December 31, 2017.  
For all contracts awarded prior to October 1, 2017, the Contractor shall notify the DoD Chief Information Officer 
(CIO), via email at osd.dibcsia@mail.mil, within 30 days of contract award, of any security requirements specified by 
NIST SP 800-171 not implemented at the time of contract award. (B)  The Contractor shall submit requests to vary from 
NIST SP 800-171 in writing to the Contracting Officer, for consideration by the DoD CIO.  The Contractor need not 
implement any security requirement adjudicated by an authorized representative of the DoD CIO to be nonapplicable or 
to have an alternative, but equally effective, security measure that may be implemented in its place.     If the DoD 
CIO has previously adjudicated the contractor’s requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an 
alternative security measure is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting 
Officer when requesting its recognition under this contract. (D)  If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud 
service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the 
Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those 
established by the Government for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline 
(https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in 
paragraphs  through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and 
protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage 
assessment. (3)  Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that 
information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this clause, 
may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special circumstances (e.g., 
medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability.  
These measures may be addressed in a system security plan. 
  Cyber incident reporting requirement. 
(1)  When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the 
covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor’s ability to perform the requirements of 
the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, the Contractor 
shall 
(i)  Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, 
identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts.  This review shall also include 
analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as well as other information 
systems on the Contractor’s network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify 
compromised covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor’s ability to provide operationally critical 
support; and 
(ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at https://dibnet.dod.mil. 
(2)  Cyber incident report.  The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall 
include, at a minimum, the required elements at https://dibnet.dod.mil. 
(3)  Medium assurance certificate requirement.  In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the 
Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber 
incidents.  For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, see https://public.cyber.mil/
eca/. 
(d)  Malicious software.  When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection 
with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with 
instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer.  Do not send the malicious software to the Contracting 
Officer. 
  Media preservation and protection.  When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall 
preserve and protect images of all known affected information systems identified in paragraph (1)(i) of this clause 
and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report 
to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest. 
(f)  Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis.  Upon request by DoD, the 
Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic 
analysis. 
(g)  Cyber incident damage assessment activities.  If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting 
Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with 
paragraph  of this clause. 
(h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information.  The Government shall protect 
against the unauthorized use or release of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information 
obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information, 
CONTINUATION SHEET

SPE7M1-25-P-1399
including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph .  To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor 
shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information.  In making an authorized release of such information, 
the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information 
that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the 
authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.  
(i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD.  Information that 
is obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is 
not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD 
(1)  To entities with missions that may be affected by such information; 
(2)  To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents; 
(3)  To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations; 
(4)  For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with 
Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or 
(5)  To a support services contractor (recipient) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract 
that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported 
Cyber Incident Information. 
(j)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD.  Information that is 
obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is 
created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph  of this clause) is authorized to be 
used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any 
other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based 
restrictions on the Government’s use and release of such information. 
(k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on 
the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data. 
(l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements.  The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this 
clause in no way abrogates the Contractor’s responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting 
pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a 
result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements. 
(m)  Subcontracts.  The Contractor shall 
(1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for 
operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, 
including subcontracts for commercial products or commercial services, without alteration, except to identify the 
parties.  The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its 
identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with 
the Contracting Officer; and 
(2)  Require subcontractors to 
(i)  Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 
800-171 security requirement to the Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; 
and 
(ii)  Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier 
subcontractor) as soon as practicable, when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph  of this 
clause.
