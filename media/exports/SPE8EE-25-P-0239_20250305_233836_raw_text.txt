SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
  
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause 
  
Adequate security means protective measures that are commensurate with the consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to, or 
modification of information. 
  
Compromise means disclosure of information to unauthorized persons, or a violation of the security policy of a system, in which unauthorized intentional or 
unintentional disclosure, modification, destruction, or loss of an object, or the copying of information to unauthorized media may have occurred. 
  
Contractor attributional/proprietary information means information that identifies the contractor(s), whether directly or indirectly, by the grouping of 
information that can be traced back to the contractor(s) (e.g., program description, facility locations), personally identifiable information, as well as trade 
secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially sensitive information that is not customarily shared outside of the company. 
  
Controlled technical information means technical information with military or space application that is subject to controls on the access, use, reproduction, 
modification, performance, display, release, disclosure, or dissemination. Controlled technical information would meet the criteria, if disseminated, for 
distribution statements B through F using the criteria set forth in DoD Instruction 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents. The term does 
not include information that is lawfully publicly available without restrictions.

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
252.247-7023   TRANSPORATION OF SUPPLIES BY SEA --- BASIC   (OCT 2024)   DFARS
Basic.  As prescribed in 247.574(b) and (b)(1), use the following clause: 
(a)  Definitions.  As used in this clause -- 
“Foreign-flag vessel” means any vessel that is not a U.S.-flag vessel. 
“Ocean transportation” means any water-borne transportation aboard a ship, vessel, boat, barge, ferry, or the like outside the internal waters of the United 
States as defined in 33 CFR 2.24. 
“Subcontractor” means a supplier, materialman, distributor, or vendor at any level below the prime contractor whose contractual obligation to perform results 
from, or is conditioned upon, award of the prime contract and who is performing any part of the work or other requirement of the prime contract. 
“Supplies” means supplies that are clearly identifiable for eventual use by or owned by DoD at the time of transportation by sea, or are otherwise transported 
by DoD, regardless of ownership or use by DoD.  An item is clearly identifiable for eventual use by DoD if, for example, the contract documentation 
contains a reference to a DoD contract number or a military destination. 
“U.S.-flag vessel” means either a vessel belonging to the United States or a vessel of the United States as that term is defined in 46 U.S.C. 116.. 
(b)(1)  The Contractor shall use U.S.-flag vessels when transporting any supplies by sea under this contract. 
(2)  A subcontractor transporting supplies by sea under this contract shall use U.S.-flag vessels if -- 
(i)  This contract is a construction contract; or 
(ii)  The supplies being transported are -- 
(A)  Other than commercial products; or 
(B)  Commercial products that -- 
(1)  The Contractor is reselling or distributing to the Government without adding value (generally, the Contractor does not add value to items that it 
subcontracts for f.o.b. destination shipment); 
(2)  Are shipped in direct support of U.S. military contingency operations, exercises, or forces deployed in humanitarian or peacekeeping operations; or 
(3)  Are commissary or exchange cargoes transported outside of the Defense Transportation System in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2643. 
(c)  The Contractor and its subcontractors may request, via the Contracting Officer, a waiver of the requirement to use a U.S.-flag vessel, or identification of 
any available U.S.-flag vessels, if the Contractor or a subcontractor sufficiently explains that -- 
(1)  U.S.-flag vessels are not available at a fair and reasonable rate for commercial vessels of the United States; or 
(2)  U.S.-flag vessels are otherwise not available. 
(d)  The Contractor must submit any request for use of foreign-flag vessels in writing to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days prior to the sailing date 
necessary to meet its delivery schedules.  The Contracting Officer will process requests submitted after such date(s) as expeditiously as possible, however, if 
a DoD waiver is not approved prior to shipper's sailing date, this will not of itself constitute a compensable delay under this or any other clause of this 
contract.  Requests shall contain at a minimum -- 
(1)  Type, weight, and cube of cargo; 
(2)  Required shipping date; 
(3)  Special handling and discharge requirements; 
(4)  Loading and discharge points; 
(5)  Name of shipper and consignee; 
(6)  Prime contract number; and 
(7)  A documented description of current, diligent efforts made to secure U.S.-flag vessels, including points of contact (with names and telephone numbers) 
with at least two U.S.-flag carriers contacted.  Copies of quotes will suffice for this purpose.  Copies of telephone notes, emails, and other relevant 
communications will otherwise be considered for this purpose. 
(e)  The Contractor shall, within 30 days after each shipment covered by this clause, provide the Contracting Officer and the Maritime Administration, Office 
of Cargo Preference, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC 20590, one copy of the rated on board vessel operating 
carrier's ocean bill of lading, which shall contain the following information: 
(1)  Prime contract number; 
(2)  Name of vessel; 
(3)  Vessel flag of registry; 
(4)  Date of loading; 
(5)  Port of loading; 
(6)  Port of final discharge; 
(7)  Description of commodity; 
(8)  Gross weight in pounds and cubic feet if available; 
(9)  Total ocean freight in U.S. dollars; and 
(10)  Name of the carrier. 
(f)  If this contract exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, the Contractor shall provide with its final invoice under this contract a representation that to 
the best of its knowledge and belief -- 
(1)  No ocean transportation was used in the performance of this contract; 
(2)  Ocean transportation was used and only U.S.-flag vessels were used for all ocean shipments under the contract; 
(3)  Ocean transportation was used, and the Contractor had received a prior-approved waiver for U.S.-flag vessels for all foreign-flag ocean transportation; or 
(4)  Ocean transportation was used and some or all of the shipments were made on foreign-flag vessels without the written consent of DoD. The Contractor 
shall describe these shipments in the following format:

(g)  If this contract exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and the final invoice does not include the required representation, the Government will reject 
and return it to the Contractor as an improper invoice for the purposes of the Prompt Payment clause of this contract.  In the event there has been 
unauthorized use of foreign-flag vessels in the performance of this contract, the Contracting Officer is entitled to equitably adjust the contract, based on the 
unauthorized use. 
(h)  If the Contractor indicated in response to the solicitation provision, Representation of Extent of Transportation by Sea, that it did not anticipate 
transporting by sea any supplies; however, after the award of this contract, the Contractor learns that supplies will be transported by sea, the Contractor -- 
(1)  Shall notify the Contracting Officer of that fact; and 
(2)  Hereby agrees to comply with all the terms and conditions of this clause. 
(i)  Subcontracts.  In the award of subcontracts, for the types of supplies described in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, including subcontracts for commercial 
products, the Contractor shall flow down the requirements of this clause as follows: 
(1)  The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (i), in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold in 
part 2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
(2)  The Contractor shall insert the substance of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this clause, and this paragraph (i), in subcontracts that are at or below the 
simplified acquisition threshold in part 2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

prohibitions as contained in section 8116, division C, title VIII, of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Pub. L. 116-260). 
(a)  In accordance with section 8116 of Division C of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Pub. L. 116-260), or any other Act that extends to fiscal 
year 2021 funds the same prohibitions, none of the funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) by this or any other Act for DoD may be used to enter 
into a contract to maintain or establish a computer network unless such network is designed to block access to pornography websites.  This prohibition does 
not limit the use of funds necessary for any Federal, State, tribal, or local law enforcement agency or any other entity carrying out criminal investigations, 
prosecution, or adjudication activities, or for any activity necessary for the national defense, including intelligence activities. 
(b)  Representation.  By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it is not providing as part of its offer a proposal to maintain or establish a 
computer network unless such network is designed to block access to pornography websites.
