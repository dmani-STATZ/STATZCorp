52.219-28 POST-AWARD SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAM REREPRESENTATION (MAR 2023) (FAR) 
As prescribed in 19.309(c)(1), insert the following clause:  
(a) Definitions. As used in this clause -  
Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five 
years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option 
to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.  
Small business concern -  
(1) Means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field of operation, and qualified as a small 
business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (d) of this clause.  
(2) Affiliates, as used in this definition, means business concerns, one of whom directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the others, or a third 
party or parties control or have the power to control the others. In determining whether affiliation exists, consideration is given to all appropriate factors 
including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships. SBA determines affiliation based on the factors set forth at 13 CFR 
121.103.  
(b) If the Contractor represented that it was any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3) prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall 
rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status according to paragraph (f) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (h) of this clause, upon occurrence of any of 
the following:  
(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation

SECTION K - REPRESENTATIONS, CERTIFICATIONS AND STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.  
(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if 
the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.  
(3) For long-term contracts -  
(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and  
(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the date specified in the contract for exercising any option thereafter.  
(c) If the Contractor represented that it was any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3) prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall 
rerepresent its size and socioeconomic status according to paragraph (f) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (h) of this clause, when the Contracting 
Officer explicitly requires it for an order issued under a multiple-award contract.  
(d) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the 
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s) assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS 
code(s) can be found at https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards.  
(e) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing an end item that it does not manufacture, process, or produce itself, for a contract other than a 
construction or service contract, is 500 employees if the acquisition -  
(1) Was set aside for small business and has a value above the simplified acquisition threshold;  
(2) Used the HUBZone price evaluation preference regardless of dollar value, unless the Contractor waived the price evaluation preference; or  
(3) Was an 8(a), HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, or women-owned small business set-aside or sole-
source award regardless of dollar value.  
(f) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the representation(s) required by paragraph (b) and (c) of this clause by 
validating or updating all its representations in the Representations and Certifications section of the System for Award Management (SAM) and its other data 
in SAM, as necessary, to ensure that they reflect the Contractor's current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office in writing within the
