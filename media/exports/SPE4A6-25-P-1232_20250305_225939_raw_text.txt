(b) The Contractor shall include applicable requirements of the higher-level quality standard(s) listed in paragraph (a) of this clause and the requirement to 
flow down such standards, as applicable, to lower-tier subcontracts, in- 
(1) Any subcontract for critical and complex items (see 46.203(b) and (c)); or 
(2) When the technical requirements of a subcontract require- 
(i) Control of such things as design, work operations, in-process control, testing, and inspection; or 
(ii) Attention to such factors as organization, planning, work instruction, documentation control, and advanced metrology. 
(End of Clause)
  
E05   PRODUCT VERIFICATION TESTING   (MAY 2020)
(1) Product verification testing (PVT) under this procurement note will only apply when the contracting officer specifically invokes it in writing. The 
contracting officer may invoke PVT at or after contract award. If the contracting officer invokes PVT at contract award, the contract will explicitly state this 
testing requirement. If the contracting officer invokes PVT after contract award, the contracting officer shall notify the contractor and the cognizant DCMA 
ACO. The Government will perform PVT testing at a Government-designated testing laboratory.  
(2) The contractor shall not ship or deliver any material until it receives notification of the acceptable PVT results, unless the contracting officer directs it to 
do so in writing The Government will provide the PVT results to the contractor within 20 business days after receipt at the Government testing facility, 
unless the Government specifies otherwise in writing.  
(3) The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government in accordance with FAR Clause 52.246-2 or 52.246-3; and 
maintain and make available all records evidencing those details if requested by the Government. When the Government finds evidence of risk associated 
with the contractor's sampling process, the Government may witness and evaluate the contractors sampling process. The contractor shall randomly select 
samples from the production lot(s), unless the contracting officer specifies otherwise in writing. The contractor shall ship the selected PVT samples with a 
copy of the system of record receiving report (i.e., WAWF, DD Form 250, or commercial shipping document) and the contractor's signed DD Form 1222. 
The contractor shall prepare the shipping container(s) by marking the external packages in bold letters, “Product Verification Test Samples  - Do Not Post to 
Stock," Contract Number [  ] and Lot/Item Number [  ]” adjacent to the MIL-STD-129 (latest revision) identification markings. The contractor shall use a 
hard copy of the system of record receiving report as a packing list, in accordance with DFARS Appendix F. The contractor shall mark the exterior of the 
shipping container in accordance with MIL-STD129 (latest revision), paragraph 5.11. The contractor shall send samples by traceable means (e.g., certified or 
registered mail, United Parcel Service, Federal Express). The contractor shall include the following in the interior package:  
(a) Hard copies of the contract;   
(b) Material certifications/process operation sheets; and  
(c) Drawings used to manufacture the units and return shipping information.  
(4) The Government will return samples that pass testing and are not destroyed during evaluation to the contractor at the Government's expense for the 
contractor to include as part of the total contract quantity to be delivered under the contract. The contractor and Government may agree to dispose of samples 
not destroyed when the cost of the item does not justify the shipping expense. If the Government does not return approved samples that pass testing to the 
contractor, the Government will consider those samples as part of the contract quantity for payment and delivery.  
(5) If samples fail testing, the Government may reject the entire contract lot from which the contractor took the samples. The Government may, at its 
discretion, retain samples that fail testing without obligation to the contractor.

E04   PRODUCTION LOT TESTING   (MAY 2020)
(1) The purpose of production lot testing (PLT) is to validate quality conformance of products. The Government conducts PLT on the 
production lot(s) after first article approval, when a first article is required. The contractor shall price the PLT CLIN to cover the cost of any 
approved samples that are consumed, destroyed, or otherwise rendered unusable during testing. The unit of issue for the PLT CLIN, EACH, is 
equal to one Production Lot Test (1EA=1PLT).  
(2) For purposes of facilitating PLT, the engineering support activity and/or testing facility has authority to communicate and conduct 
clarifications directly with contractors. If this results in necessary changes to contract requirements, the contractor shall contact the post award 
contracting officer or contract administrator (see the “Issued By” blocks on the contract award or order) for written approval. The contractor 
shall not act on any revisions or other changes until the contracting officer issues a written modification approving the proposed revision(s)/
change(s).  
(3) The contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government in accordance with FAR Clause 52.246-2 or 
52.246-3, and maintain and make available all records evidencing those details if requested by the Government. At least fourteen (14) 
calendar days (or as otherwise specified in the contract) prior to the date when the contractor will present the production lot for selection of PLT 
samples, the contractor shall provide written notice to the contracting officer (and the cognizant DCMA functional specialist when full 
administration or quality support administration is delegated to DCMA).  
(4) Unless otherwise stated, the contractor shall select [ 5 ] samples, at random from the production lot(s) produced. If the quantity stated in the 
previous sentence equals “ZZ,” the contractor shall use the appropriate sample size identified in the technical data package or applicable 
sample plan provided by the Government. If the contractor cannot determine the sample quantity, the contractor shall obtain written 
confirmation of the sample size from the contracting officer.   
(5) If a PLT sample fails, the entire production lot from which the contractor took the sample fails. The contractor shall propose corrective 
action, if appropriate.  
(6) The Government will return PLT samples to the contractor, with a copy of the test report, at contractor expense.  
(7) The contractor shall prepare and disseminate the samples as follows:  
(a) Ship the selected PLT samples by traceable means. [Mark the shipment “Production Lot Samples  - Do Not Post To Stock,” Contract 
Number [  ] and Lot/Item Number [   ]”. Place a copy of the system of record receiving report (i.e., WAWF or DD Form 250) on the exterior of 
the shipping container in accordance with DFARS Appendix F. Mark the exterior of the shipping container in accordance with MIL-STD-129

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, “Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal 
Information Systems and Organizations”, Revision 2 (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171). 
  
(ii)(A) The Contractor shall implement NIST SP 800-171, as soon as practical, but not later than December 31, 2017. For all contracts awarded prior to 
October 1, 2017, the Contractor shall notify the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), via email at osd.dibcsia@mail.mil, within 30 days of contract award, 
of any security requirements specified by NIST SP 800-171 not implemented at the time of contract award. 
  
(B) The Contractor shall submit requests to vary from NIST SP 800-171 in writing to the Contracting Officer, for consideration by the DoD CIO. The 
Contractor need not implement any security requirement adjudicated by an authorized representative of the DoD CIO to be nonapplicable or to have an 
alternative, but equally effective, security measure that may be implemented in its place. 
  
(C) If the DoD CIO has previously adjudicated the contractor's requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure 
is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer when requesting its recognition under this contract. 
  
(D) If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this 
contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requirements equivalent to those established by the 
Government for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline (https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/) 
and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, 
media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment. 
  
(3) Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to 
those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate 
special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These 
measures may be addressed in a system security plan. 
  
(c) Cyber incident reporting requirement. 
  
(1) When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, 
or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the 
contract, the Contractor shall -- 
  
(i) Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, 
specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as 
well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised 
covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and 
  
(ii) Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at https://dibnet.dod.mil. 
  
(2) Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required 
elements at https://dibnet.dod.mil. 
  
(3) Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or 
acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, 
see https://public.cyber.mil/eca/. 
  
(d) Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit 
the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the 
malicious software to the Contracting Officer. 
  
(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all 
known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from 
the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest. 
  
(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to 
additional information equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis. 
  
(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor 
provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause. 
  
(h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of 
information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/
proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall 
identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate

procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that 
information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released. 
  
(i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or 
derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD -- 
  
(1) To entities with missions that may be affected by such information; 
  
(2) To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents; 
  
(3) To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations; 
  
(4) For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in 
the program at 32 CFR part 236); or 
  
(5) To a support services contractor (“recipient”) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, 
Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information. 
  
(j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived 
from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph 
  
(i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the 
Government's use and release of such information. 
  
(k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, 
and disclosure of electronic communications and data. 
  
(l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's 
responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of 
this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements. 
  
(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall -- 
  
(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which 
subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial products or commercial services, without 
alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as 
covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and 
  
(2) Require subcontractors to -- 
  
(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the 
Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and 
  
(ii) Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, 
when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.
