E08   FIRST ARTICLE TESTING REQUIREMENTS   (APR 2024)
(1) If there is not a separate contract line item number (CLIN) for FAT, the offeror shall include all costs and risk associated with completion of the FAT 
requirement in the production CLIN price. 
(2) If there is a separate FAT CLIN, the offeror shall include all costs and risk associated with completion of the FAT requirement in the FAT CLIN price. 
The unit of issue for the FAT CLIN, EACH, is equal to one First Article Test (1EA=1FAT). To receive payment for any costs associated with FAT, the 
offeror shall propose costs associated with FAT on a separate CLIN. The offeror shall base the production CLIN price solely on all costs associated with 
completion of the production units and shall exclude all FAT-related costs. 
(3) The contracting officer will use the total award price in selecting the best value offer from among all eligible offerors. However, for an offeror to be 
eligible for award, the contracting officer must determine that the FAT CLIN price (unless FAT is waived) and the production CLIN price are fair and 
reasonable; and, if set-aside under FAR Part 19, a fair market price. The offeror shall not propose a FAT CLIN price that is materially unbalanced in relation 
to the production CLIN price. In the event an offeror receives a waiver of the FAT requirement, the contracting officer will deduct the FAT CLIN price for 
the waived source in determining the total award price. 
(4)(a) Notwithstanding the conditions for waiving first article, the contracting officer may order an additional first article sample, or portion thereof, in 
writing if there is a -- 
(i) Major change to the technical data; 
(ii) Lapse in production for a period in excess of 90 days; or 
(iii) Change in the place of performance (manufacturing facility), manufacturing process,material used, drawing, specification or source of supply. 
(b) When conditions in paragraphs (4)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii) occur, the contractor shall notify the contracting officer; who will determine whether to order an 
additional first article sample or portion thereof and provide instructions concerning the submission, inspection, and notification of results. The contractor 
shall bear the costs of the additional first article testing resulting from any of the causes in paragraphs (4)(a)(i)-(iii) instituted by the contractor and not due to 
changes directed by the Government. 
(5) Waivers. The offeror may submit a request for FAT waiver to the contracting officer, who may waive the FAT requirement when all of the following 
criteria apply: 
(a) The offeror requesting waiver has manufactured and delivered the item or a similar item within the last three (3) years regardless of item criticality.  The 
offeror shall provide the following information and be prepared to provide documentary evidence upon the contracting officer's request: 
(i) Contract number(s), date(s), and issuing Government agency or agencies. 
(ii) Description of item previously furnished, identified by part number, type, model number and/or other identifying information. If the item previously 
furnished is similar but not identical to the item being acquired under the current buy, the offeror shall explain why manufacture of the item previously 
furnished is sufficient to demonstrate its ability to manufacture the item being acquired under the current buy without need for a first article test. 
(iii) Engineering control document/change number of item previously furnished. 
(b) There have been no changes to manufacturing processes, tooling, or place of performance. 
(c) There have been no changes to manufacturing data (e.g., drawing revisions that change materials, dimensions, processes, inspection or testing 
requirements; or subcontractors used to manufacture the items successfully in the past). 
(d) The offeror shall supply an item of the same design and manufactured by the same method at the same facilities as the item or similar item previously 
furnished and accepted under subparagraph (5)(a)  
(6) Contractor-Performed FAT. 
(a) The contractor shall test the quantities as outlined in paragraph (a) of FAR clause 52.209-3 as specified in the contract. The contractor shall submit reports 
in accordance with paragraph (b) of FAR clause 52.209-3, as supplemented in this procurement note.

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requirements apply: 
  
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, “Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal 
Information Systems and Organizations”, Revision 2 (available via the internet at http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171).

and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, 
media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for forensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment. 
  
(3) Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to 
those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate security in a dynamic environment or to accommodate 
special circumstances (e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These 
measures may be addressed in a system security plan. 
  
(c) Cyber incident reporting requirement. 
  
(1) When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, 
or that affects the contractor's ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designated as operationally critical support and identified in the 
contract, the Contractor shall -- 
  
(i) Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, 
specific data, and user accounts. This review shall also include analyzing covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as 
well as other information systems on the Contractor's network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised 
covered defense information, or that affect the Contractor's ability to provide operationally critical support; and 
  
(ii) Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at https://dibnet.dod.mil. 
  
(2) Cyber incident report. The cyber incident report shall be treated as information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required 
elements at https://dibnet.dod.mil. 
  
(3) Medium assurance certificate requirement. In order to report cyber incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or 
acquire a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. For information on obtaining a DoD-approved medium assurance certificate, 
see https://public.cyber.mil/eca/. 
  
(d) Malicious software. When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit 
the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Officer. Do not send the 
malicious software to the Contracting Officer. 
  
(e) Media preservation and protection. When a Contractor discovers a cyber incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all 
known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from 
the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest. 
  
(f) Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis. Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to 
additional information equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis. 
  
(g) Cyber incident damage assessment activities. If DoD elects to conduct a damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor 
provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause. 
  
(h) DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary information. The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release of 
information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor attributional/

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c). To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor shall 
identify and mark attributional/proprietary information. In making an authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate 
procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that 
information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released. 
  
(i) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or 
derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD -- 
  
(1) To entities with missions that may be affected by such information; 
  
(2) To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, or mitigation of cyber incidents; 
  
(3) To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law enforcement investigations; 
  
(4) For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in 
the program at 32 CFR part 236); or 
  
(5) To a support services contractor (“recipient”) that is directly supporting Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204-7009, 
Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information. 
  
(j) Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by or for DoD. Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived 
from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) 
of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities authorized by paragraph 
  
(i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the 
Government's use and release of such information. 
  
(k) The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, 
and disclosure of electronic communications and data. 
  
(l) Other safeguarding or reporting requirements. The safeguarding and cyber incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor's 
responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of 
this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements. 
  
(m) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall -- 
  
(1) Include this clause, including this paragraph (m), in subcontracts, or similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which 
subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial products or commercial services, without 
alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as 
covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with the Contracting Officer; and 
  
(2) Require subcontractors to -- 
  
(i) Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) when submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800-171 security requirement to the 
Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and 
  
(ii) Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, to the prime Contractor (or next higher-tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, 
when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, 
whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must 
have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be 
qualified at the time of award whether or not  the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified 
manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements  that they or their 
products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate 
their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification.  
http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsSearch.aspx 
(c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant 
information noted below should be provided.  
Offeror's Name:     
Manufacturer's Name:   
Source's Name:       
Item Name:        
Service Identification:      
Test Number:      (to the extent known)  
(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source 
must  nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will  ultimately provide the 
product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable  qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time 
of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for  default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the 
action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.  
(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requireme nt but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified 
manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must  submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the 
Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.  
(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of 
the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. 
The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.

address of the Government activity to receive the report] marked “First Article Test Report: Contract No.   SPE7L125P3166  , Lot/Item No.   1015 / 
013461794  ” Within 45   calendar days after the Government receives the test report, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor, in writing, of the 
conditional approval, approval, or disapproval of the first article. The notice of conditional approval or approval shall not relieve the Contractor from 
complying with all requirements of the specifications and all other terms and conditions of this contract. A notice of conditional approval shall state any 
further action required of the Contractor. A notice of disapproval shall cite reasons for the disapproval.  
(c) If the first article is disapproved, the Contractor, upon Government request, shall repeat any or all first article tests. After each request for additional tests, 
the Contractor shall make any necessary changes, modifications, or repairs to the first article or select another first article for testing. All costs related to these 
tests are to be borne by the Contractor, including any and all costs for additional tests following a disapproval. The Contractor shall then conduct the tests and 
deliver another report to the Government under the terms and conditions and within the time specified by the Government. The Government shall take action 
on this report within the time specified in paragraph (b) of this subsection. The Government reserves the right to require an equitable adjustment of the 
contract price for any extension of the delivery schedule, or for any additional costs to the Government related to these tests. 
(d) If the Contractor fails to deliver any first article report on time, or the Contracting Officer disapproves any first article, the Contractor shall be deemed to 
have failed to make delivery within the meaning of the Default clause of this contract. 
(e) Unless otherwise provided in the contract, and if the approved first article is not consumed or destroyed in testing, the Contractor may deliver the 
approved first article as part of the contract quantity if it meets all contract requirements for acceptance. 
(f) If the Government does not act within the time specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this subsection, the Contracting Officer shall, upon timely written 
request from the Contractor, equitably adjust under the changes clause of this contract the delivery or performance dates and/or the contract price, and any 
other contractual term affected by the delay. 
(g) Before first article approval, the acquisition of materials or components for, or the commencement of production of, the balance of the contract quantity is 
at the sole risk of the Contractor. Before first article approval, the costs thereof shall not be allocable to this contract for (1) progress payments, or (2) 
termination settlements if the contract is terminated for the convenience of the Government. 
(h) The Government may waive the requirement for first article approval test where supplies identical or similar to those called for in the schedule have been 
previously furnished by the offeror/contractor and have been accepted by the Government. The offeror/contractor may request a waiver.

regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.  
(5) Covered Government support contractor means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204 -7014)under a contract, the 
primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's 
management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the 
contractor --  
(i) Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or 
any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and

used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.  
(7) Developed means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process 
practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable 
people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is 
required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, 
component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process 
be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.  
(8) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a 
government contract, or any combination thereof.  
(i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.  
(ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs 
necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.  
(9) Developed exclusively with government funds means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.  
(10) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a 
government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.  
(11) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the 
qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally 
interchangeable items.

(B) Created with mixed funding in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, 
components, or processes.  
(ii) The five-year period, or such other period as may have been negotiated, shall commence upon execution of the contract, subcontract, letter contract (or 
similar contractual instrument), contract modification, or option exercise that required development of the items, components, or processes or creation of the 
data described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this clause. Upon expiration of the five-year or other negotiated period, the Government shall have unlimited 
rights in the technical data.  
(iii) The Government shall not release or disclose technical data in which it has government purpose rights unless --  
(A) Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the non-disclosure agreement at 227.7103 -7 of the Defense Federal Acquisition 
Regulation Supplement (DFARS); or  
(B) The recipient is a Government contractor receiving access to the data for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS

technical data --  
(A) Pertaining to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and marked with the limited rights legend prescribed in 
paragraph (f) of this clause; or  
(B) Created exclusively at private expense in the performance of a contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production 
of items, components, or processes.  
(ii) The Government shall require a recipient of limited rights data for emergency repair or overhaul to destroy the data and all copies in its possession 
promptly following completion of the emergency repair/overhaul and to notify the Contractor that the data have been destroyed.  
(iii) The Contractor, its subcontractors, and suppliers are not required to provide the Government additional rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, 
perform, display, or disclose technical data furnished to the Government with limited rights. However, if the Government desires to obtain additional rights 
in technical data in which it has limited rights, the Contractor agrees to promptly enter into negotiations with the Contracting Officer to determine whether 
there are acceptable terms for transferring such rights. All technical data in which the Contractor has granted the Government additional rights shall be listed 
or described in a license agreement made part of the contract. The license shall enumerate the additional rights granted the Government in such data.  
(iv) The Contractor acknowledges that --  
(A) Limited rights data are authorized to be released or disclosed to covered Government support contractors;  
(B) The Contractor will be notified of such release or disclosure;

contractor to enter into a non-disclosure agreement directly with the Contractor (or the party asserting restrictions) regarding the covered Government 
support contractor's use of such data, or alternatively, that the Contractor (or party asserting restrictions) may waive in writing the requirement for a non-
disclosure agreement; and  
(D) Any such non-disclosure agreement shall address the restrictions on the covered Government support contractor's use of the limited rights data as set 
forth in the clause at 252.227 -7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends. The non-
disclosure agreement shall not include any additional terms and conditions unless mutually agreed to by the parties to the non-disclosure agreement.  
(4) Specifically negotiated license rights. The standard license rights granted to the Government under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this clause, 
including the period during which the Government shall have government purpose rights in technical data, may be modified by mutual agreement to provide 
such rights as the parties consider appropriate but shall not provide the Government lesser rights than are enumerated in paragraph (a)(14) of this clause. Any 
rights so negotiated shall be identified in a license agreement made part of this contract.  
(5) Prior government rights. Technical data that will be delivered, furnished, or otherwise provided to the Government under this contract, in which the 
Government has previously obtained rights shall be delivered, furnished, or provided with the pre-existing rights, unless --  
(i) The parties have agreed otherwise; or  
(ii) Any restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose the data have expired or no longer apply.  
(6) Release from liability. The Contractor agrees to release the Government from liability for any release or disclosure of technical data made in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(14) or (b)(2)(iii) of this clause, in accordance with the terms of a license negotiated under paragraph (b)(4) of this clause, or by others to 
whom the recipient has released or disclosed the data and to seek relief solely from the party who has improperly used, modified, reproduced, released, 
performed, displayed, or disclosed Contractor data marked with restrictive legends.  
(c) Contractor rights in technical data. All rights not granted to the Government are retained by the Contractor.  
(d) Third party copyrighted data. The Contractor shall not, without the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any copyrighted data in the 
technical data to be delivered under this contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained for the Government the license rights necessary 
to perfect a license or licenses in the deliverable data of the appropriate scope set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, and has affixed a statement of the 
license or licenses obtained on behalf of the Government and other persons to the data transmittal document.  
(e) Identification and delivery of data to be furnished with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. (1) This paragraph does not apply to restrictions based 
solely on copyright.  
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, technical data that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government with restrictions on 
use, release, or disclosure are identified in an attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The Contractor shall not deliver any data with restrictive markings 
unless the data are listed on the Attachment.  
(3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other assertions may be identified after award when based on new information or inadvertent 
omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification and assertion shall be submitted 
to the Contracting Officer as soon as practicable prior to the scheduled date for delivery of the data, in the following format, and signed by an official 
authorized to contractually obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government's Use, Release, or Disclosure of Technical 
Data.

(4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the 
Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertion, at a 
later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract.  
(f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, 
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data subject to restriction. 
Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights legend at 
paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; 
and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.  
(1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all 
technical data that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed 
material, each page of the printed material containing technical data for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are 
subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data 
transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. Reproductions of technical data or any 
portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.  
(2) Government purpose rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as 
follows: 
GOVERNMENT PURPOSE RIGHTS  
  
Contract No.:    
Contractor Name:   
Contractor Address :   
Expiration Date:   
The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights 
in Technical Data --Other Than Commercial Products or Commercial Services clause contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after 
the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. 
(End of legend)  
(3) Limited rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with limited rights shall be marked with the following legend:  
LIMITED RIGHTS  
Contract No.:    
Contractor Name:   
Contractor Address :   
The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rights 
in Technical Data --Other Than Commercial Products or Commercial Services clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of 
technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided 
access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor. 
(End of legend)  
(4) Special license rights markings. (i) Data in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following 
legend:  
SPECIAL LICENSE RIGHTS   
The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these data are restricted by Contract No.  (Insert contract number), 
License No.  (Insert license identifier) . Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. 
(End of legend)  
(ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of this 
clause).  
(5) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, 
reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may 
mark such data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.  
(g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical 
data with other than unlimited rights, shall --  
(1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and 
(2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data delivered under this contract.  
(h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings --(1) Unjustified technical data markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the 
validation of restrictive markings on technical data furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
Technical Data clause of this contract. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, 
at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data 
clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.  
(2) Nonconforming technical data markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data delivered or otherwise furnished to the 
Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of 
Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the 
Contractor fails to remove or correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any 
nonconforming marking.  
(i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of 
any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.  
(j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but not limited to, license fees, 
royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data to be delivered under this contract when --  
(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data; or  
(ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.  
(2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause --  
(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier 
technical data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to 
the Government; and  
(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will be delivered.  
(k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) The Contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 3771 
-3775, 10 U.S.C. 3781 -3786, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.  
(2) Whenever any technical data for other than commercial products or commercial services, or for commercial products or commercial services developed 
in any part at Government expense, is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall 
use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, including subcontracts or other contractual instruments for commercial products or 
commercial services, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern the 
technical data pertaining to noncommercial items or to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at 
Government expense, and the clause at 252.227 -7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed 
exclusively at private expense. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher-tier subcontractor's or 
supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data.  
(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or 
supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or 
supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier 
contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.  
(4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical 
data from their subcontractors or suppliers.  
(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to 
satisfy its contractual obligations to the Government.

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
“Ocean transportation” means any water-borne transportation aboard a ship, vessel, boat, barge, ferry, or the like outside the internal waters of the United 
States as defined in 33 CFR 2.24. 
“Subcontractor” means a supplier, materialman, distributor, or vendor at any level below the prime contractor whose contractual obligation to perform results 
from, or is conditioned upon, award of the prime contract and who is performing any part of the work or other requirement of the prime contract. 
“Supplies” means supplies that are clearly identifiable for eventual use by or owned by DoD at the time of transportation by sea, or are otherwise transported 
by DoD, regardless of ownership or use by DoD.  An item is clearly identifiable for eventual use by DoD if, for example, the contract documentation 
contains a reference to a DoD contract number or a military destination. 
“U.S.-flag vessel” means either a vessel belonging to the United States or a vessel of the United States as that term is defined in 46 U.S.C. 116.. 
(b)(1)  The Contractor shall use U.S.-flag vessels when transporting any supplies by sea under this contract. 
(2)  A subcontractor transporting supplies by sea under this contract shall use U.S.-flag vessels if -- 
(i)  This contract is a construction contract; or 
(ii)  The supplies being transported are -- 
(A)  Other than commercial products; or 
(B)  Commercial products that -- 
(1)  The Contractor is reselling or distributing to the Government without adding value (generally, the Contractor does not add value to items that it 
subcontracts for f.o.b. destination shipment); 
(2)  Are shipped in direct support of U.S. military contingency operations, exercises, or forces deployed in humanitarian or peacekeeping operations; or 
(3)  Are commissary or exchange cargoes transported outside of the Defense Transportation System in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2643. 
(c)  The Contractor and its subcontractors may request, via the Contracting Officer, a waiver of the requirement to use a U.S.-flag vessel, or identification of 
any available U.S.-flag vessels, if the Contractor or a subcontractor sufficiently explains that -- 
(1)  U.S.-flag vessels are not available at a fair and reasonable rate for commercial vessels of the United States; or 
(2)  U.S.-flag vessels are otherwise not available. 
(d)  The Contractor must submit any request for use of foreign-flag vessels in writing to the Contracting Officer at least 45 days prior to the sailing date 
necessary to meet its delivery schedules.  The Contracting Officer will process requests submitted after such date(s) as expeditiously as possible, however, if 
a DoD waiver is not approved prior to shipper's sailing date, this will not of itself constitute a compensable delay under this or any other clause of this 
contract.  Requests shall contain at a minimum -- 
(1)  Type, weight, and cube of cargo; 
(2)  Required shipping date; 
(3)  Special handling and discharge requirements; 
(4)  Loading and discharge points; 
(5)  Name of shipper and consignee; 
(6)  Prime contract number; and 
(7)  A documented description of current, diligent efforts made to secure U.S.-flag vessels, including points of contact (with names and telephone numbers)

52.248-1   VALUE ENGINEERING   (JUN 2020)   FAR
As prescribed in 48.201, insert the following clause: 
(a) General. The Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and submit value engineering change proposals (VECP's) voluntarily. The Contractor shall 
share in any net acquisition savings realized from accepted VECP's, in accordance with the incentive sharing rates in paragraph (f) below. 
(b) Definitions. Acquisition savings, as used in this clause, means savings resulting from the application of a VECP to contracts awarded by the same 
contracting office or its successor for essentially the same unit. Acquisition savings include -- 
(1) Instant contract savings, which are the net cost reductions on this, the instant contract, and which are equal to the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by 
the number of instant contract units affected by the VECP, less the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs; 
(2) Concurrent contract savings, which are net reductions in the prices of other contracts that are definitized and ongoing at the time the VECP is accepted; 
and 
(3) Future contract savings, which are the product of the future unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of future contract units in the sharing base. On 
an instant contract, future contract savings include savings on increases in quantities after VECP acceptance that are due to contract modifications, exercise 
of options, additional orders, and funding of subsequent year requirements on a multiyear contract. 
Collateral costs, as used in this clause, means agency cost of operation, maintenance, logistic support, or Government-furnished property. 
Collateral savings, as used in this clause, means those measurable net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency's overall projected collateral costs, 
exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost changes. 
Contracting office includes any contracting office that the acquisition is transferred to, such as another branch of the agency or another agency's office that is 
performing a joint acquisition action. 
Contractor's development and implementation costs, as used in this clause, means those costs the Contractor incurs on a VECP specifically in developing, 
testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as those costs the Contractor incurs to make the contractual changes required by Government 
acceptance of a VECP. 
Future unit cost reduction, as used in this clause, means the instant unit cost reduction adjusted as the Contracting Officer considers necessary for projected 
learning or changes in quantity during the sharing period. It is calculated at the time the VECP is accepted and applies either (1) throughout the sharing 
period, unless the Contracting Officer decides that recalculation is necessary because conditions are significantly different from those previously anticipated 
or (2) to the calculation of a lump-sum payment, which cannot later be revised. 
Government costs, as used in this clause, means those agency costs that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as any net 
increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and logistics support. The term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing the 
VECP or any increase in this contract's cost or price resulting from negative instant contract savings. 
Instant contract, as used in this clause, means this contract, under which the VECP is submitted. It does not include increases in quantities after acceptance of 
the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, or additional orders. If this is a multiyear contract, the term does not include quantities 
funded after VECP acceptance. If this contract is a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm 
prices have been established. 
Instant unit cost reduction means the amount of the decrease in unit cost of performance (without deducting any Contractor's development or implementation 
costs) resulting from using the VECP on this, the instant contract. If this is a service contract, the instant unit cost reduction is normally equal to the number 
of hours per line-item task saved by using the VECP on this contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract labor rate. 
Negative instant contract savings means the increase in the cost or price of this contract when the acceptance of a VECP results in an excess of the 
Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs over the product of the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract 
units affected. 
Net acquisition savings means total acquisition savings, including instant, concurrent, and future contract savings, less Government costs. 
Sharing base, as used in this clause, means the number of affected end items on contracts of the contracting office accepting the VECP. 
Sharing period, as used in this clause, means the period beginning with acceptance of the first unit incorporating the VECP and ending at a calendar date or 
event determined by the contracting officer for each VECP. 
Unit, as used in this clause, means the item or task to which the Contracting Officer and the Contractor agree the VECP applies. 
Value engineering change proposal (VECP) means a proposal that -- 
(1) Requires a change to this, the instant contract, to implement; and 
(2) Results in reducing the overall projected cost to the agency without impairing essential functions or characteristics; provided, that it does not involve a 
change --

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
(i) In deliverable end item quantities only; 
(ii) In research and development (R&D) end items or R&D test quantities that is due solely to results of previous testing under this contract; or 
(iii) To the contract type only. 
(c) VECP preparation. As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in each VECP the information described in subparagraphs (1) through (8) below. If the 
proposed change is affected by contractually required configuration management or similar procedures, the instructions in those procedures relating to 
format, identification, and priority assignment shall govern VECP preparation. The VECP shall include the following: 
(1) A description of the difference between the existing contract requirement and the proposed requirement, the comparative advantages and disadvantages of 
each, a justification when an item's function or characteristics are being altered, the effect of the change on the end item's performance, and any pertinent 
objective test data. 
(2) A list and analysis of the contract requirements that must be changed if the VECP is accepted, including any suggested specification revisions. 
(3) Identification of the unit to which the VECP applies. 
(4) A separate, detailed cost estimate for (i) the affected portions of the existing contract requirement and (ii) the VECP. The cost reduction associated with 
the VECP shall take into account the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs, including any amount attributable to subcontracts under 
the Subcontracts paragraph of this clause, below. 
(5) A description and estimate of costs the Government may incur in implementing the VECP, such as test and evaluation and operating and support costs. 
(6) A prediction of any effects the proposed change would have on collateral costs to the agency. 
(7) A statement of the time by which a contract modification accepting the VECP must be issued in order to achieve the maximum cost reduction, noting any 
effect on the contract completion time or delivery schedule. 
(8) Identification of any previous submissions of the VECP, including the dates submitted, the agencies and contract numbers involved, and previous 
Government actions, if known. 
(d) Submission. The Contractor shall submit VECP's to the Contracting Officer, unless this contract states otherwise. If this contract is administered by other 
than the contracting office, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the VECP simultaneously to the Contracting Officer and to the Administrative Contracting 
Officer. 
(e) Government action. (1) The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor of the status of the VECP within 45 calendar days after the contracting office 
receives it. If additional time is required, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and 
the expected date of the decision. The Government will process VECP's expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP. 
(2) If the VECP is not accepted, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor in writing, explaining the reasons for rejection. The Contractor may 
withdraw any VECP, in whole or in part, at any time before it is accepted by the Government. The Contracting Officer may require that the Contractor 
provide written notification before undertaking significant expenditures for VECP effort. 
(3) Any VECP may be accepted, in whole or in part, by the Contracting Officer's award of a modification to this contract citing this clause and made either 
before or within a reasonable time after contract performance is completed. Until such a contract modification applies a VECP to this contract, the Contractor 
shall perform in accordance with the existing contract. The decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP is a unilateral decision made solely at the 
discretion of the Contracting Officer. 
(f) Sharing rates. If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor shall share in net acquisition savings according to the percentages shown in the table below. The 
percentage paid the Contractor depends upon (1) this contract's type (fixed-price, incentive, or cost-reimbursement), (2) the sharing arrangement specified in 
paragraph (a) above (incentive, program requirement, or a combination as delineated in the Schedule), and (3) the source of the savings (the instant contract, 
or concurrent and future contracts), as follows: 
Contractor's Share of Net Acquisition Savings 
[Figures in Percent]
1The Contracting Officer may increase the Contractor's sharing rate to as high as 75 percent for each VECP. 
2Same sharing arrangement as the contract's profit or fee adjustment formula. 
3The Contracting Officer may increase the Contractor's sharing rate to as high as 50 percent for each VECP. 
(g) Calculating net acquisition savings. (1) Acquisition savings are realized when (i) the cost or price is reduced on the instant contract, (ii) reductions are 
negotiated in concurrent contracts, (iii) future contracts are awarded, or (iv) agreement is reached on a lump-sum payment for future contract savings (see

SECTION I - CONTRACT CLAUSES (CONTINUED)
subparagraph (i)(4) below). Net acquisition savings are first realized, and the Contractor shall be paid a share, when Government costs and any negative 
instant contract savings have been fully offset against acquisition savings. 
(2) Except in incentive contracts, Government costs and any price or cost increases resulting from negative instant contract savings shall be offset against 
acquisition savings each time such savings are realized until they are fully offset. Then, the Contractor's share is calculated by multiplying net acquisition 
savings by the appropriate Contractor's percentage sharing rate (see paragraph (f) above). Additional Contractor shares of net acquisition savings shall be 
paid to the Contractor at the time realized. 
(3) If this is an incentive contract, recovery of Government costs on the instant contract shall be deferred and offset against concurrent and future contract 
savings. The Contractor shall share through the contract incentive structure in savings on the instant contract items affected. Any negative instant contract 
savings shall be added to the target cost or to the target price and ceiling price, and the amount shall be offset against concurrent and future contract savings. 
(4) If the Government does not receive and accept all items on which it paid the Contractor's share, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the 
proportionate share of these payments. 
(h) Contract adjustment. The modification accepting the VECP (or a subsequent modification issued as soon as possible after any negotiations are 
completed) shall -- 
(1) Reduce the contract price or estimated cost by the amount of instant contract savings, unless this is an incentive contract; 
(2) When the amount of instant contract savings is negative, increase the contract price, target price and ceiling price, target cost, or estimated cost by that 
amount; 
(3) Specify the Contractor's dollar share per unit on future contracts, or provide the lump-sum payment; 
(4) Specify the amount of any Government costs or negative instant contract savings to be offset in determining net acquisition savings realized from 
concurrent or future contract savings; and 
(5) Provide the Contractor's share of any net acquisition savings under the instant contract in accordance with the following: 
(i) Fixed-price contracts --add to contract price. 
(ii) Cost-reimbursement contracts --add to contract fee. 
(i) Concurrent and future contract savings. (1) Payments of the Contractor's share of concurrent and future contract savings shall be made by a modification 
to the instant contract in accordance with subparagraph (h)(5) above. For incentive contracts, shares shall be added as a separate firm-fixed-price line item on 
the instant contract. The Contractor shall maintain records adequate to identify the first delivered unit for 3 years after final payment under this contract. 
(2) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of concurrent contract savings by (i) subtracting from the reduction in price negotiated on 
the concurrent contract any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet offset and (ii) multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing 
rate. 
(3) The Contracting Officer shall calculate the Contractor's share of future contract savings by (i) multiplying the future unit cost reduction by the number of 
future contract units scheduled for delivery during the sharing period, (ii) subtracting any Government costs or negative instant contract savings not yet 
offset, and (iii) multiplying the result by the Contractor's sharing rate. 
(4) When the Government wishes and the Contractor agrees, the Contractor's share of future contract savings may be paid in a single lump sum rather than in 
a series of payments over time as future contracts are awarded. Under this alternate procedure, the future contract savings may be calculated when the VECP 
is accepted, on the basis of the Contracting Officer's forecast of the number of units that will be delivered during the sharing period. The Contractor's share 
shall be included in a modification to this contract (see subparagraph (h)(3) above) and shall not be subject to subsequent adjustment. 
(5) Alternate no-cost settlement method. When, in accordance with section 48.104-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), the Government and the 
Contractor mutually agree to use the no-cost settlement method, the following applies: 
(i) The Contractor will keep all the savings on the instant contract and on its concurrent contracts only. 
(ii) The Government will keep all the savings resulting from concurrent contracts placed on other sources, savings from all future contracts, and all collateral 
savings. 
(j) Collateral savings. If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount, as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this clause, 
by a rate from 20 to 100 percent, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of 
use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor's share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract's firm-
fixed-price, target price, target cost, or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer will be 
the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings. 
(k) Relationship to other incentives. Only those benefits of an accepted VECP not rewardable under performance, design-to-cost (production unit cost, 
operating and support costs, reliability and maintainability), or similar incentives shall be rewarded under this clause. However, the targets of such incentives 
affected by the VECP shall not be adjusted because of VECP acceptance. If this contract specifies targets but provides no incentive to surpass them, the value 
engineering sharing shall apply only to the amount of achievement better than target. 
(l) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract-valued at or above the simplified acquisition 
threshold, as defined in FAR 2.101 on the date of subcontract award, and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In calculating any adjustment in 
this contract's price for instant contract savings (or negative instant contract savings), the Contractor's allowable development and implementation costs shall 
include any subcontractor's allowable development and implementation costs, and any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor, clearly 
resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract. The Contractor may choose any arrangement for subcontractor value engineering 
incentive payments; provided, that the payments shall not reduce the Government's share of concurrent or future contract savings or collateral savings. 
(m) Data. The Contractor may restrict the Government's right to use any part of a VECP or the supporting data by marking the following legend on the 
affected parts: 
“These data, furnished under the Value Engineering clause of contract , shall not be disclosed outside the Government or duplicated, used, or disclosed, in 
whole or in part, for any purpose other than to evaluate a value engineering change proposal submitted under the clause. This restriction does not limit the 
Government's right to use information contained in these data if it has been obtained or is otherwise available from the Contractor or from another source 
without limitations.” 
If a VECP is accepted, the Contractor hereby grants the Government unlimited rights in the VECP and supporting data, except that, with respect to data 
qualifying and submitted as limited rights technical data, the Government shall have the rights specified in the contract modification implementing the VECP
