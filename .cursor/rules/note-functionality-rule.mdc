# Adding Note functionality to a page

This implementation follows modern web development practices:
    - It uses a modal dialog for a better user experience
    - It leverages AJAX for form submission to avoid page reloads
    - It provides visual feedback for reminders with icons
    - It's reusable across different pages and entities
    
To use this functionality on other pages, you would:
1. Include the modal template: 
    {% include "contracts/partials/note_modal.html" %}
2. Include the JavaScript file: 
    <script src="{% static 'contracts/js/note_modal.js' %}"></script>
3. Add data attributes to your "Add Note" buttons:
   <button 
       data-note-action="add"
       data-content-type-id="[CONTENT_TYPE_ID]"
       data-object-id="[OBJECT_ID]"
       data-entity-type="[ENTITY_TYPE]"
   >
       Add Note
   </button>
